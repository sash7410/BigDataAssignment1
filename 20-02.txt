@@31620441 <h> Tailor-made vaccines could almost halve rates of serious bacterial disease <p> New research has found that rates of disease caused by the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae could be substantially reduced by changing our approach to vaccination . Researchers from the Wellcome Sanger Institute , Simon Fraser University in Canada and Imperial College London combined genomic data , models of bacterial evolution and predictive modelling to identify how vaccines could be optimised for specific age groups , geographic regions and communities of bacteria . <p> The study , published today ( 3 February ) in Nature Microbiology , simulated the performance of vaccines over time to assess the risk of vaccine-targeted strains being replaced by other potentially dangerous strains . Through this predictive modelling approach , the researchers identified new vaccine designs that could help reduce overall rates of disease . <p> S. pneumoniae is often found at the back of the nasal cavity , where it is normally harmless . But when it migrates to other parts of the body , it can cause serious bacterial infections such as pneumonia , sepsis and meningitis - known collectively as invasive pneumococcal disease ( IPD ) . IPD was estimated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the introduction of widespread vaccination , with higher rates of disease in many low- or middle- income countries* . Infants and the elderly are most at risk . <p> Vaccines against pneumococcus have prevented millions of infections . But like many bacteria , S. pneumoniae is difficult to target with vaccines because infection can be caused by different serotypes** . Each part of a vaccine usually protects against a single serotype , with the most complex pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( PCV13 ) targeting 13 serotypes . <p> Because there are approximately 100 S. pneumoniae serotypes around the world , vaccine effectiveness varies between countries depending on which serotypes are present . When serotypes are removed from circulation by a particular vaccine , other serotypes of S. pneumoniae rise to take their place . <p> In this study , researchers at the Wellcome Sanger Institute , Simon Fraser University and Imperial College London optimised a computer model to approximate the effect of vaccines targeting different serotype combinations . Analysis of vaccine effectiveness was then carried out on S. pneumoniae genomic data from Massachusetts , USA and the Maela refugee camp in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many designs are possible , each with different effects on disease . In Maela , for example , the presence of 64 S. pneumoniae serotypes means around 100 trillion vaccine designs are possible . But it would take 19,000 years to simulate them all , with most being sub-optimal . The researchers developed a more efficient method that made it feasible to identify the best-performing designs from the trillions of possibilities . <p> The team discovered that rates of infant IPD in Maela could actually be reduced by omitting components from the PCV13 vaccine to keep certain serotypes in place , removing the possibility of their replacement by highly-invasive serotypes . In Massachusetts , a vaccine targeting 20 serotypes was found to be more effective than the current PCV13 . <p> The results highlight the need for vaccine programmes to be tailored to specific communities of bacteria and to consider vaccination at different ages . <p> Dr Nicholas Croucher , of the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis , Imperial College London , said : " Our research shows that the best vaccine designs strongly depend on the bacterial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries . The best vaccine designs also depend on the age group being vaccinated . These ideas will be critical for applying lessons learned from introducing vaccines in high-income countries to combatting the disease where the burden is highest . " <p> Vaccination of infants also affects IPD in adults . However , trends in IPD can differ between infants and the elderly in the same country , as seen recently in the UK . In many places , older adults already receive an S. pneumoniae vaccine , which was designed before the infant vaccine . The study also found that adult disease rates could be reduced by almost 50 per cent by redesigning adult vaccines to complement those administered to infants . <p> Professor Caroline Colijn , of Simon Fraser University and the Wellcome Sanger Institute , said : " This approach to optimising vaccines will help to address several problems , such as invasive disease among infants or adults and minimising antibiotic resistance in the post vaccine population .

S. pneumoniae infections are sometime resistant to multiple antibiotics and have been highlighted as a priority threat by the WHO*** .

The approach we describe in this study will play an important role in accelerating future vaccine discovery and design to help reduce rates of disease .

The headline read : with China accused of major coronavirus cover-up as chilling satellite pics ' show extent of corpse burning in Wuhan ' . <p> It said : " After careful confirmation , we found that the SO2 rise published by windy.com was a ' serious distortion ' and its statistics could not be trusted .

" <p> The tweeter confirmed he saw the rumours on the internet and decided to do his own " investigation " . However , his method proved to be misleading . <p> In recent days , some media have reported that Wuhan 's crematoria are operating 24/7 based on an interview with an employee , interviewed reportedly obtained by The Epoch Times , a conservative and anti-communist media of the Chinese community in the US . Other experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toll . <h> So what 's the truth ? <p> It is true that data on windy.com shows extremely high levels of SO2 in both cities . <p> But little or nothing allows us to establish a relationship with the alleged unbridled activity at the city 's crematoria . <p> Sulfur dioxide is naturally emitted by volcanoes . According to the WHO , the main human source of SO2 emissions is the combustion of sulphur-containing fossils used for domestic heating , electricity generation and motor vehicles as well as the burning of waste and the decomposition of organic matter . <h> Models used for forecasts are not " satellite measures " <p> The data on windy.com is not based on satellite images , as claimed by the Sun tabloid newspaper in its headline . <p> Instead , they are based upon forecasts based on NASA 's GEOS-5 model , which , according to the US agency itself , often give significantly higher results than observations . <p> The models are not updated to take into account episodes like the coronavirus . They 're based on " emissions inventories " , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known sources of emissions . <p> They take into account the usual sources of emissions of an area : factories , power and heating plants , and cross-references them with meteorological variables .

But it also has an archive of measures .

@@31644141 <h> Worker on board Diamond Princess says crew are at greater risk of coronavirus <p> A crew member aboard the virus-hit Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Japan said she fears the crew are at greater risk of being exposed to the outbreak because they are not being quarantined in the same way as the passengers and are having to continue working to take care of the guests . <p> More than 3,700 passengers and crew are stuck on the cruise ship in Yokohama that became a floating quarantine zone after dozens of people tested positive for the novel coronavirus earlier this month . <p> The cruise ship has the largest outbreak of the virus outside of mainland China , with the number of infections continuing to increase day by day . On Wednesday , Japanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato announced 40 new cases among those on board . <p> To date , a total of 175 people aboard the Diamond Princess have become infected . But while those confirmed to have the virus have been sent to local hospitals , the remaining passengers and crew have been in quarantine on the ship since February 4 . <p> Media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passengers who paid thousands of dollars for the cruise and are now confined to their rooms . The quarantine , which is scheduled to end on February 19 , has led to cabin fever among many -- with passengers only allowed out on deck for a limited time . <p> But as the quarantine continues more than 1,000 crew members remain at work , providing for and interacting with potentially infected passengers and taking care of the ship . They work wearing their uniforms , masks and gloves . <p> Japan 's Vice Minister of Health Gaku Hashimoto told CNN that , " We are trying to treat all the people equally . " <p> " We also know that crew members do n't have private rooms like the passengers have , and they still have to work and help on the ship , so it is not all equal . However , we are giving everyone on the ship guidelines for prevention , " Hashimoto added . <p> In a statement posted on their site , Princess Cruises said that , all crew members who have been cleared after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are " fulfilling their duties as required " and additional crew testing by health officials is ongoing .

She is part of the security team on board the ship , working on the gangway as passengers are moved on and off . <p> Thakkar said she and her colleague -- who she shares a cabin with -- became ill with a headache , cough and a fever two days ago . Her supervisor told her to stop working and she is currently staying in her cabin in isolation . <p> " I 'm not eating very well and have been having fevers , " she told CNN in a Skype call Wednesday .

At least five have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleagues continue to live and work in close proximity with each other , sharing cabins and eating together . <p> She said there are some crew members whose job it is to serve food to the isolated passengers and those on the security team , for example , who had been working around infected people . <p> " And then we all eat together . There are many places where we all are together , not separated from each other , " Thakkar said . " Especially when we sit in the same mess hall and eat together , the place where it can spread very fast . " <p> She worries that they do n't know who could be infected with the virus , especially as they continue to work around each other and the passengers . <p> " There are many more crew members who have been isolated to their cabins who are not even being tested yet , " she said . <p> Thakkar told CNN that her biggest concern is that the crew are not being separated from one another . She said " there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passengers . " <p> " We just want every crew member to be tested and separated from the rest of the people who are infected . Because we do n't know who is carrying the virus or how fast it is spreading , " she said . <p> Thakker is explicit in not criticizing the company or authorities . The crew , she said , do n't mind working , but they just want assurance that they can work in a " safe environment " where they know they " wo n't be the next person to get infected . " <p> " We just want to feel safe . We do n't feel safe here with so many people , " she said . <p> On Wednesday , Japan 's Health Minister Kato said a " quarantine officer , " who came aboard the ship to help with the isolation had tested positive for the virus . <h> Questions over the quarantine method <p> Infectious disease experts have expressed skepticism that the current quarantine system is the best way to contain the virus . <p> Peter Hotez , Dean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College of Medicine , told CNN there are concerns that Japan and the cruise line are not handling the situation properly . <p> " We know that we 're taking infected patients off the ship and we know they 're infectious . So if you 've got the protective measures to take them off the ship safely , I do n't see why you would n't take the others off . " <p> Keeping everyone on board is potentially endangering the crew , said Eric Rubin , professor of immunology at Harvard University . " I think a lot of thought went into what to do with the passengers , but it puts the crew at increased risk . It 's a closed environment , a ship . It 's the perfect place for an infectious disease to spread , " said Rubin . <p> In a video statement on Wednesday , Princess Cruises Executive Vice President Rai Caluori said that " the quarantine protocols on board the Diamond Princess are completely under the control of the Japanese Ministry of Health . " <p> CNN has requested further comment from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Princess Cruises . <p> According to Caluori the more than 1,000 crew currently working on board the ship will receive " normal pay and gratuities and paid time off following the quarantine . " <p> Caluori assured guests and cited a letter sent to passengers and crew by Amy Schuchat of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention saying that , " The CDC has no evidence to suggest that the virus can spread between rooms on a ship through the air handling system . " <p> He added that in abundance of caution the ship is " maximizing the percentage of fresh air in crew and guest cabins as well as public spaces . " <p> On Tuesday , ship Captain Stefano Ravera sought to reassure those on board about the ship 's air conditioning system . <p> In a public address to the ship , Ravera said , " I would like to assure you that we are indeed supplying 100% fresh air throughout the ship , including your staterooms .

@@31645041 <h> The lessons of West Africa 's Ebola 's crisis will save the continent from the worst of coronavirus <p> The Ebola outbreak across West Africa between 2013 and 2014 was devasting taking more than 11,000 lives in three countries . And yet , it could have been so much worse but for the heroic actions of Nigerian doctor , Ameyo Stella Adadevoh . <p> With the viral outbreak already taking hold across West Africa in Sierra Leone , Guinea and Liberia , the threat of a devastating outbreak loomed large in Nigeria -- by far the region 's largest country . And it nearly proved to be the case but for Dr. Adadevoh 's selflessness . As part of the team that diagnosed , quarantined and treated Nigeria 's first Ebola patient in Lagos , Dr. Adadevoh helped contain what could have proved a deadly outbreak in Nigeria 's densely populated commercial center . Ultimately , it came at the cost of her life . <p> " As bad as Ebola was , it was also a learning process and you can see that now . " <p> As African countries appear at risk of another viral outbreak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now known ) , effective containment this time around will likely require more than valiant heroics . The World Health Organization and other regional and country public health experts are very worried the " fragile " health systems in most African countries will be unable to cope if coronavirus takes hold on the continent . Even China with its larger pool of technical and financial resources , appears to be struggling to contain the virus . <p> With nearly 5,000 African students studying in Hubei province where Wuhan is ground zero for the deadly virus and many more Africans living across China the continent 's risk of an outbreak is very real . <p> Yet , in dealing with a potential COVID-19 outbreak on the continent , the African countries most recently affected by a previous viral pandemic will be leaning heavily on the past to address the present . <h> The legacy of Ebola <p> More than 11,000 people died in Liberia , Guinea , and Sierra Leone alone during the 2014 Ebola outbreak . And the cost of the outbreak was also counted in economic terms with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ebola also left affected countries with increased knowledge bases of how to handle viral outbreaks . <p> " Our preparedness is based on the system we built after Ebola , " says Dr. Mosoka Fallah , acting lead of Liberia 's National Public Health Institute . " The national institute that 's now leading preparedness for coronavirus did not exist before Ebola , " he says . " The skill did not exist before , the knowledge did not exist before , the manpower did not exist before and the infrastructure did not exist before . " <p> The aftermath of Ebola now means West African countries including Senegal , Liberia , Sierra Leone , Cote d'Ivoire and Nigeria currently rank as better prepared for COVID-19 than richer countries with more sophisticated health systems , says Gyude Moore , fellow at Center for Global Development in Washington D.C and former minister for public works in Liberia . <p> Compared to 2014 , there are already far more African countries capable of testing and diagnosing COVID-19 samples . Last week , the number of laboratories in Africa able to test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nigeria and Sierra Leone joining a short list that previously only included Senegal and South Africa . For its part , Fallah says while Liberia still awaits chemical testing components for its lab , it already has the infrastructure in place to test COVID-19 samples . It 's a crucial step in preparedness given the importance of early detection and monitoring during viral outbreaks . <p> Having tested health surveillance and tracking systems is also key . Nigeria 's wider health system has also stepped up in tracking persons believed to have come in contact with any viral outbreak 's patient zero thanks to the country 's Centre for Disease Control 's ( CDC ) established network for dealing with diseases like Lassa fever , yellow fever and polio , says Dr. Mcginger Ibeneme , unit head for Lassa fever at the Nnamdi Azikwe University teaching hospital in Nnewi , southeast Nigeria . " We were able to actively trace every contact as soon it was reported , " Ibeneme says of the Ebola crisis six years ago . " There was no magic , it 's not like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure for surveillance in all the Nigerian states . " <h> People power <p> While infrastructure , medication and know-how are vital in dealing with pandemics , they only remain a part of the solution . As the Ebola outbreak proved , health systems and workers will invariably also rely on getting locals to adopt simple but crucial behavioral changes , including consistent hand washing and ditching self-medication practices . <p> Given how long the process of vaccine development takes , behavior changes remain a low-hanging fruit for containing outbreaks . " If you 're going to control the spread and the transmission , behavior changes are going to be the first and probably best line of defense because it 'll take a while before we can find medical intervention , " Moore says . " By the time you are able to develop a medical counter-measure , the virus would have done significant damage . " <p> But getting the message of behavior change across to locals is not so simple given cultural or even religious nuances . <p> Amid the Ebola outbreak in Liberia , with the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the process of burial rites , it took the country 's head Imam going on national radio to discuss the issue before significant change was noticed . " The government could have gone on radio as many times as we wanted but it would n't have been enough to alter people 's behavior , " says Moore , who was a government minister at the time . " It 's about finding repositories of trust and incorporating them into your incidence response system . " <p> AP Photo/Aurelie Marrier d'Unienville <p> Fighting with information . <p> Optimizing authority figures to get the message serves a double-purpose of changing social behavior and winning the public over as allies to supplement weak health systems especially where gaps in surveillance and patient tracking can worsen the outbreak , as seen in Sierra Leone . " The initial surveillance system in Sierra Leone was not enough to contain the disease and there was an escalation , " says Ibeneme who spent six months in the country as response team lead for the African Union . " That escalation made surveillance even more delicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible behavior changes now better understood , especially in the countries worst affected by Ebola , chances are locals will now be far more receptive . And there 's already some early-day evidence to support that notion : " There 's more awareness and people are more proactive now , " Fallah says . " As bad as Ebola was , it was also a learning process and you can see that now . " <h> Getting set <p> Ultimately , not all African countries can reflect on direct Ebola lessons and suffering one viral outbreak does n't exactly render a country immune from another -- as DR Congo 's 10th and ongoing Ebola outbreak shows . Given close travel and trade links to China , African countries still broadly remain at risk . <p> For the best outcomes in a viral outbreak , " It 's better to over-prepare than to over-react . " <p> To ensure the best possible outcome in the event of an outbreak , African countries must prepare for the worst . " It 's better to over-prepare than to over-react , " Moore says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we knew of outbreaks that had happened in the past and , when the outbreak exceeded anything that had happened before , we were grossly unprepared . " Where they do n't exist already , preparedness should begin with selecting sites and locations for temporary hospital set-ups to isolate and treat patients and kicking off awareness campaigns early , Moore says . <p> But given the reality of underfunded health systems across the continent , preparedness levels often mirror financial capabilities . And that 's where global bodies like the World Health Organization ( WHO ) matter . " Putting funding into this stage of preparation efforts across Africa will be the best investment at this stage , " Fallah says . For its part , WHO also has some learning to do in that regard having faced widespread criticism for its slow response to the Ebola crisis in 2014 . <p> Reuters/Francis Kokoroko <p> Officials at Accra 's international airport on alert to screen passengers in the wake of coronavirus outbreak . <p> As African countries look to learn from what worked during the Ebola crisis , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods . " We tried to quarantine entire communities like we see China doing now but that proved counter productive because you have to engage them , " says Moore . " You want the community to continue to retain its trust of the authorities so you have to act in ways that promote trust not undermine it . " <p> Just like during the Ebola outbreak , countries will likely be tempted to insulate themselves as an instinctive protective measure but the chances of ending the outbreaks hinge on collaboration rather than isolation , Moore adds : " These outbreaks end if the response is collective , not individual "

The rate of new cases there has slowed and this demonstrates that by moving swiftly it is possible to manage this , at least for a while .

Having good public health communication campaigns that reach all our communities is vital not only to reduce risk of spread but also to ensure people are not afraid and know how to be prepared . Ultimately , this may become just one of the many infections we live with . Also , there comes a point at which risk declines , people become immune and there are fewer people to spread the virus , it runs out of susceptible hosts .

Take sips of water every 15 minutes because even if the virus gets into your mouth by drinking water or liquids , it will wash the virus down through your esophagus and into your stomach where your stomach acid will kill the virus . <p> THE FACTS : Drinking water prevents dehydration but will not prevent anyone from catching the new coronavirus .

As news spread about the outbreak , social media accounts began promoting the idea that drinking chlorine dioxide or related products with names like Miracle Mineral Solution would help wipe out the virus . The FDA told The Associated Press in a statement that they do not recommend ingesting this product . " We understand people are concerned about the spread of the novel coronavirus and we urge people to talk to their health care provider about treatment options , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spread of this illness , " the agency said .

Experts say there is no evidence that the new virus causes fibrosis .

Colloidal silver is made up of silver particles suspended in a liquid . The liquid solution is often pushed as a miracle solution to boost the immune system and cure diseases .

Four cases are still under investigation and there was insufficient evidence to make out offences in two of them , he said . <p> Of the remaining 31 , 10 cases were " serious offences " and resulted in jail terms of between 10 days and eight months , Mr Ong said . These include cases of outrage of modesty or multiple instances of voyeurism . <p> In addition to police investigations , the universities also carry out their own disciplinary processes and mete out a combination of penalties within its power .

But neither should expulsions be the default for all forms of misconduct , " he added . <p> There has to be a " significant " adjustment at the most egregious end of the spectrum of misconducts when they are serious criminal offences that undermine the safety and security of university campuses , he said . <p> Mr Ongadded that if the offender is remorseful and has accepted and been served punishment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Singapore must recognise that voyeurism is a growing concern . With growing exposure to the Internet at an early age and technological advances that have made video recording easier and more undetectable , this has led some to think that voyeurism is not a serious offence . <p> " The young today grow up with the Internet . They are exposed to pornography websites . They know of miniature photography and recording devices and sometimes they get it through their WhatsApp . Over time , they may have the idea that this is no big deal . This is what we are worried about . It does n't manifest in terms of higher incidence rates , at least over the last three years ... but we do worry about this underlying trend , " Mr Ong said . <p> " As our circumstances change , the AUs must likewise keep up with the times and ensure that their policies and processes remain relevant in establishing a safe and supportive environment for all students , " the minister said . <p> Across AUs , polytechnics and Institutes of Technical Educations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he added . <p> MP Foo Mee Har asked if MOE would consider prescribing minimum standards to the disciplinary actions that will be meted out for as the universities are reviewing its disciplinary frameworks . <p> In response , Mr Ong said that the ministry needs to respect the autonomy of AUs in having their own board and governing themselves , separate from MOE . <p> " For us to issue standards , codes or rules to the universities , I think it would not be appropriate . We can do that for polytechnics because they are statutory boards and for ITEs , " Mr Ong explained . <p> OPPORTUNITY TO REFLECT ON CHARACTER OF SOCIETY <p> Mr Ong said the strong reaction to Ms Monica Baey 's situation showed that people in Singapore have a strong sense of justice , who see the importance of differentiating between right and wrong . <p> " But we should always refrain from trial by media , doxxing and resorting to mob justice .

They must identify their bank accounts and confiscate their property , assets and money and jail the big-time traders . It is essential to ban all sale and trading in wildlife .

@@51411941 <h> China Oil Demand Has Plunged 20% Because of the Virus Lockdown <p> ( Bloomberg ) -- Chinese oil demand has dropped by about 3 million barrels a day , or 20% of total consumption , as the coronavirus squeezes the economy , according to people with inside knowledge of the country 's energy industry . <p> The drop is probably the largest demand shock the oil market has suffered since the global financial crisis of 2008 to 2009 , and the most sudden since the Sept. 11 attacks . It could force the hand of OPEC and its allies , which are considering an emergency meeting to cut production and staunch the decline in prices . <p> " It is truly a black swan event for the oil market , " said John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital LLC in New York . " There was some hope for the demand outlook this year before the outbreak , but that has been knocked off its block . OPEC+ has to react . If there are no further production cuts , there will only be more price losses . " <p> Crude futures fell to one-year lows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health crisis in China . Brent , the global oil benchmark , dropped 1.3% to $55.91 a barrel as of 1:53 p.m. in London . West Texas Intermediate declined as much as 2.2% , and traded 0.5% lower at $51.33 . <p> China is the world 's largest oil importer , after surpassing the U.S. in 2016 , so any change in consumption has an outsize impact on the global energy market . The country consumes about 14 million barrels a day -- equivalent to the combined needs of France , Germany , Italy , Spain , the U.K. , Japan and South Korea . <p> Chinese and Western oil executives , speaking on condition of anonymity because they are n't authorized to discuss the matter publicly , said the decline was measured against normal levels for this time of year . It 's a measure of the current drop in demand , rather than the average loss since the crisis started , which would be smaller . <p> Beijing has locked millions of people in quarantine and the New Year holiday has been extended . Flights have been canceled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virus 's spread . Traditionally during the New Year holiday , gasoline and jet-fuel demand increase as hundred of millions go back home , while gasoil consumption drops as industrial activity slows . <p> The collapse in Chinese oil consumption is starting to reverberate across the global energy market , with sales of some crudes slowing to a crawl and benchmark prices in free-fall . Sales of Latin American oil cargoes to China came to a halt last week , while sales of West African crude , a traditional source for Chinese refineries , are also slower than usual , traders said . <p> Chinese refineries are storing unsold petroleum products such as gasoline and jet fuel , according to the executives . But stockpiles are growing every day , and some refineries may soon reach their storage limits . If that were to happen , they would have to cut the amount of crude they process . One executive said that refinery runs were likely to be cut soon by 15-20% . <p> There are signs that 's already happening . Sinopec Group , the nation 's biggest refiner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants by an average of about 13-15% and will review whether further cuts are needed Feb. 9 , according to one of the people . The company declined to comment on its operations . <p> As many as 18 independent oil refineries may be cutting rates or shutting completely as storage fills up , according to traders familiar with operations at the plants known as teapots . China has as many as 40 of these independent refineries , which are located primarily in the eastern region of Shandong and account for about a quarter of the nation 's processing capacity . <p> Beyond the headline price for Brent , every other indicator in the physical and derivatives market also points to a weakening market . So-called time-spreads , which measure the price difference between contracts for delivery at different times , have collapsed -- an indication that short-term demand is expected to remain weak . <p> In China , stocks plummeted by the most since an equity bubble burst in 2015 as they resumed trading to the worsening virus outbreak . The CSI 300 Index slumped as much as 9.1% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jan. 23 , while the yuan tumbled and crude futures in Shanghai also sank by more than 7% . <p> OPEC and its allies , which include Russia , are weighing their options to respond to the crisis and there have been discussions about calling an emergency meeting . Saudi Arabia is pressing for a gathering sooner than the one scheduled for March 5-6 , though it has run into resistance from Russia . The Saudi and Russian oil ministers spoke on the phone for an hour on Thursday and another 30 minutes on Friday , according to Russians officials . <p> For now , OPEC has called a technical meeting this week to assess the situation , and the Joint Technical Committee will report back to ministers . <p> According to consultants at Energy Aspects Ltd. , OPEC is considering an informal proposal to deepen current production curbs by about 500,000 barrels a day . But there 's no consensus on the idea , which was floated by at least one country . As OPEC and its partners are already in the midst of steep cuts , many analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . <p> The most recent agreed reductions only came together after considerable diplomatic wrangling , and Saudi Arabia has already slashed production to the lowest since 2014 . Russia , which has become the most important producer in the coalition alongside the kingdom , has typically taken some persuading to sign up to additional cuts . Still , if the alliance does agree to call an early meeting , historic precedent suggests it will probably result in action . <p> " Nothing concentrates a producer 's mind more than the prospect of a crude oil price bust , " said Bob McNally , president of Rapidan Energy Group , and a former White House oil official under President George W. Bush .

Sign up here . <p> South Korea offered global policy makers an alternative approach for dealing with the impact of the coronavirus outbreak by refraining from a knee-jerk interest rate cut to help a struggling economy at the heart of the global tech supply chain . <p> Bank of Korea Governor Lee Ju-yeol said the appropriate response at this stage was targeted support for the companies most affected by the biggest virus outbreak outside China , not a wider-reaching rate reduction . That 's even after downgrading growth forecasts for the year and acknowledging that the epidemic could push the economy into reverse this quarter . <p> A majority of economists polled by Bloomberg had expected the bank to respond by lowering the rate to a fresh record low , repeating a similar move taken by the bank following a virus outbreak in 2015 . <p> The BOK 's measured response comes after the Federal Reserve , the European Central Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global growth if the virus epidemic continues to escalate . While some Asian banks have already opted to cut rates , there 's still little consensus on the best way to respond even after a meeting of G-20 finance and monetary chiefs at the weekend . <p> " A health security crisis is the cause of the current economic difficulties , " Lee said . " In a situation like that , micro support for self-employed businesses and companies in trouble is more effective than an interest-rate cut . " <p> Specifically , the BOK announced an increase in the cap for cheap loans available to companies affected by an accelerating virus outbreak in Korea that has now topped 1,500 cases and left pockets of the country locked down . The BOK 's lending facility is one of the policy tools it uses to manage funding conditions , and it has raised the ceiling during previous economic downturns . <p> A somewhat similar response was taken by the People 's Bank of China earlier this month when it provided medium-term funding to commercial lenders and cut the interest rate it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everywhere .

Economists who projected a rate hold pointed to concerns about an overheated property market and high household debt , alongside a weakening currency . <p> " The BOK may cut rates after the government rolls out an extra budget in March , creating the impression that the two are working closely , " Meritz Securities Co. economist Stephen Lee said . " For now , providing support for small businesses while keeping the rate on hold is the optimal choice for the BOK .

Much of the scepticism came largely as the Budget was more of intent and lacked sufficient concrete measures to enthuse local demand , even as the emerging uncertainty from the coronavirus outbreak has not yet been factored in . <p> " To get the Indian economy out of the ongoing slump , bolder decisions were required and that 's where this Budget failed to deliver , " brokerage Bernstein ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Budget for 2020-21 " directionless " . <p> Most brokerage houses believe the government 's allocation for subsidies and spending on social and rural schemes -- just 7% higher from last year -- is lower than that needed to pump-prime the economy . <p> The cut in allocation to the government 's flagship job guarantee scheme and the expected sharp slump in capital expenditure growth to 2% next financial year from an estimated 16% in the current one are worries , said brokerage Ambit Capital . <p> The brokerage 's report titled ' How long can hope be a strategy ' pithily summarised that changes in the Budget were cosmetic in nature and " will have minimal effect " on economic growth next year . <p> Analysts also expressed concerned over the ability of the government to bridge the revenue-expenditure gap next year , with some stating that the expected 2.1 trln rupees from disinvestment in state-owned companies was a tall ask . <p> The extent of hand-wringing over prospects of economic growth can be gauged from the post-Budget note by Kotak Institutional Equities that said " No hope without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little on concrete action , the market is expected to look for succour in smaller events such as gains that could accrue from the abolition of dividend distribution tax . <p> Bernstein India reiterated that the benchmark Nifty 50 index would give returns of only 5% in 2020 and that the Budget was broadly neutral for every sector . <p> Was the market expecting too much , asked BofA Securities rhetorically , stating that the finance minister had restricted fiscal deficit in line with expectation , but noting that the recent excitement in mid-cap stocks could peter out . <p> " The markets ' disappointment with the Budget will last a short while ...

The number of infected and dead people is rising every day and there is no existing proven treatment or vaccine .

Now we see how unprepared these global and national health authorities are when the real killer diseases come . <p> And still the WHO and country governments continue with more regulations of products and lifestyles to " protect people from themselves , " the evolving role of a nanny state . Target products are alcohol , tobacco , electronic cigarettes , sugar , and salt/sodium . Despite the fact that anywhere in the world , people are living longer and healthier even if they have rising consumption of alcohol , tobacco , sugar/fatty food and drinks . <p> I checked the narrative that " more alcohol and tobacco = more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not hold water . For instance , China and Indonesia have higher smoking prevalence ( SP ) than the Philippines yet they have higher life expectancy than us .

Meaning government wants more tax money from them to fund its universal healthcare ( UHC ) and related programs , yet government wants less use and sale of these products . Which is which ? <p> On raising the minimum age for vaping or smoking to 21 , this is more double talk . At the age of 18 , the government currently believes that people are mature enough to vote and determine political leadership at local and national levels , they can drive vehicles and are mature enough not to cause injuries or deaths on the road , they can get married , and so on . Then government changes the rules because people below 21 are still immature and need to be protected from themselves . <p> More bans , restrictions , and taxation only encourage more corruption and smuggling . The result is more drinking , smoking , vaping , and drugs because the smuggled products are cheaper . JS Mill has warned of the dangers of more social control -- government must heed this .

Recently , the ban was clarified to include Taiwan , which , according to the WHO , is considered a special administrative region of the People 's Republic of China . ( This was subsequently dropped after Taiwan complained . -- Ed . ) <p> The ban however does not cover Filipino citizens and holders of permanent resident visas issued by the Philippine government .

Should they be expected to wait abroad where they are , until the travel ban is lifted ? And , whose responsibility would they be : the airlines ' or the government 's ? <p> The restriction on the right to travel in the case of the COVID-19 outbreak is hardly arguable considering that it falls squarely within the government 's mandate to protect " public health .

In fact , some lead indicators ( such as housing and inflation ) are beginning to point to 2020 being stronger than 2019 , which would allow the RBA to hold some of their monetary policy ammunition in reserve . <p> Rather than focusing on the current narrative of a slow economy , we pose in our latest paper five big picture questions the RBA should be answering to land at our interest rate outlook and what it means for domestic bond yields in 2020 . A summary of our views is below and the full PDF can be accessed here . <h> Q1 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for house prices ? <p> The improved housing outlook for 2020 , compared to the beginning of 2019 , has the potential to create the " gentle turning " point the RBA has spoken of . While the recent housing related data has been sluggish , our indicators show that the economic data can take a few quarters to react . Hence , while the market has been impatient by wanting faster results , we think this may have been asking too much too soon . <p> To demonstrate this point , we show three key indicators that should show signs of improvement this year and that we believe will be important to watch in early 2020 : <p> Household demand -- The chart below shows that over the past 10 years household demand in these states has lagged house prices by approximately nine months , meaning house price conditions today will affect demand in 2 -- 4 quarter 's time . It also means that it can take some time for the RBA 's actions to flow through to the real economy . <p> Chart 1 - NSW and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Housing inflation - Over the past 10 years , housing inflation has been on a slow trend downwards , falling from 6% p.a. growth to 20-year-lows of 1% p.a . Despite this downward trend , every time the RBA has cut interest rates housing inflation has risen by 0.5% to 3% over the subsequent 12 months . Given that the response in house prices so far has been similar to previous cuts , we think there is a good argument to be made that housing inflation will also follow the same pattern -- providing an improved backdrop from last year . <p> Building approvals - The third improvement that we would expect to see is in the construction outlook for late 2020 -- as building approvals typically follow house prices with a lag . The following chart shows that building approvals usually decline with house prices and a more positive outlook should give this some support . <p> Chart 2 - House prices and building approvals <p> Source : Bloomberg <p> Prices are set to rise <p> While not related to economic data , the final point to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into more aggressive housing headlines as prices reach all-time highs . The next chart shows that the current house price index is only 4% of its 2018 peak . Since prices have been increasing at over 1% per month , we should see prices set new highs in only a few months . <p> Chart 3 - Australian house price index <p> Source : Bloomberg <p> While none of these indicators say that the improvement in housing-related sectors are a certainty , they do suggest a far stronger outlook than what we saw at the beginning of 2019 . <h> Q2 : How strong will inflation and unemployment be in 2020 ? <p> The first signs of this improvement can be seen in inflation , as currently the indicators we pay attention to point towards a grind back into the low 2% territory in the first half of 2020 . This is based off three key pieces of information , which were not in place this time last year . <p> Firstly , as noted above , housing inflation should bottom out as the housing market is showing strength . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it higher housing inflation . <p> Secondly , Australian petrol prices had started rising and this has a very strong correlation with transportation inflation . If petrol prices remain at their current levels , this would imply transportation prices see mildly positive rises into the first quarter of this year -- a small pickup compared to the 0% observed through 2019 . <p> Prior to the outbreak of the coronavirus , oil prices had actually been showing large increases year-on-year , meaning if the market recovers from this shock we could be looking at higher transport-related inflation for the year . <p> The third reason to expect higher inflation figures is simply from the distribution of inflation outcomes . The table below shows the quarterly and yearly inflation figures over the past 24 months . The main reason that headline inflation dipped so low in 2019 was that the first quarter had an inflation print of 0% quarter-on-quarter , taking the consistent 1.8 -- 2.0% inflation level into the low 1% range . Outside of this first quarter , the inflation figures had consistently remained in the 0.4% -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflation figures - 24 months <p> Source : Bloomberg <p> Given we see more inflationary signs in the beginning of 2020 than we did in 2019 , we suspect that in 1Q 2020 this zero outcome will be replaced with a higher quarterly figure , pulling inflation back towards 2% instead of 1% . <p> Unemployment outlook <p> While the unemployment rate shifted slightly higher during the year , ending 2019 at 5.1% , this was only marginally higher than the 5.0% seen at the end of 2018 . Additionally , the outright levels of employment are only marginally below the high point seen in 2007 , as the employment to population ratio ( an employment indicator which calculates what percentage of the population is working ) saw an almost record high of 62.6% of the total population working . <p> Chart 4 -- Australia : employment to population <p> Source : Bloomberg <p> It 's important to separate the narrative around employment from the facts . Yes , some forward looking indicators have started to slow ( such as job advertisements and vacancies ) , but the NAB employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the economy . We find the NAB business conditions is one of the better indicators at forecasting the unemployment rate in the near term , and this is suggesting that the unemployment rate should move sideways , i.e. 5.0 -- 5.2% , over the coming months . <p> Chart 5 - NAB employment conditions and unemployment rate change <p> Source : Bloomberg <p> This would suggest that not only was the narrative around employment misguided in 2019 , but the near-term forecast should not be as bearish as the market currently insists . <h> Q3 : Is global trade set to improve ? <p> 2019 proved to be a relatively weak year for global trade and , unsurprisingly , the Chinese trade statistics reflected this reality . However , there are some tentative signs that this could be slightly more positive for 2020 . <p> Chinese trade statistics <p> The first positive sign for global trade is that Chinese trade statistics have shown signs of life after being consistently weak for the past 12 months . Importantly for global trade , Chinese imports lead the global cycle by approximately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw a relatively large rise . This means that as long as the coronavirus does not considerably alter the momentum of the global economy , then come mid-2020 we should see signs that global trade is beginning to improve and potentially pick up dramatically in the back end of 2020 . <p> World trade and Chinese imports <p> Source : Bloomberg , World Trade Organisation <p> Reflecting this positive import outcome , the Chinese PMI figures saw new export orders rise above 50 the first time since the middle of 2018 . This is off the back of positive outcomes between China and the US on trade talks , potentially signaling that companies are becoming more positive on the future trade environment . <p> Additionally , South Korean and Taiwanese exports -- two economies which are traditionally thought of as the canary in the coal mine of global trade -- started improving . Both countries had negative outcomes through 2019 , which have started turning and could signal that the pickup is more widespread than simply China . <p> If this is true , the Australian economy should benefit from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move rates . <p> The caveat to this improvement is that these statistics have been occurring through the December and January data . Whether this improvement can continue in the face of the coronovirus is yet to be a seen and poses a large risk to global trade . This is addressed in a separate question below . <h> Q4 : Where is the Tail Risk -- The known unknowns ? <p> While we do n't cover the US -- China trade war ( as enough ink has already been spilled on this topic ) or the deterioration in relationship between Iran and the US in this outlook , it is worthwhile pointing out the risk that could come from the coronavirus , which appears to have originated in China . <p> At the time of writing , the facts surrounding this disease are murky as the number of cases and deaths rise by the day . However , from the information available the market is so far looking at it in a similar nature as the SARS outbreak of 2003 , although it seems to be less deadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It is hard to determine just how many people will contract the disease and how long the epidemic will last , so we 're unable to forecast just how large the effect will be on international conditions . More specifically though , the fact that the Chinese government has quarantined multiple cities , with a combined population in the tens of millions of people , it means there will likely be a hit to Chinese GDP as , among the numerous other effects , consumption will be lower and tourism down . Additionally , the timing of the event over Chinese New Year means the effects will be larger than if this had of occurred at a different time of the year . <p> From this perspective , the total effect is currently unknown , but we do know that it will not be positive . The offset to this is that the Chinese government could ( and likely will ) introduce easier fiscal policy to offset the weaker conditions that their containment policies have created . Depending on the actions that they take , this could potentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year , which is followed by an acceleration in the second half . <p> Chinese demand and tourism <p> Whether these risks are enough to cause the RBA to cut or not are a key question that they will need to answer this year . Slower Chinese demand and weaker travel from Chinese tourists , which represent the greatest number of outbound tourists in the world , would be a key risk for the Australian economy , coming at a time when GDP is weak . While we think that the RBA should not overact to this information , and wait to see how global trade evolves over the next three months , it does create a story that naturally feeds into easier rates and will cause the RBA to become more dovish if it persists for some time . <h> Q5 : How will the RBA respond to the widespread bushfires ? <p> While the total financial cost from the fires is unknown at the time of writing , most estimates have put the effect on GDP in the short term at a drag of around 0.2% -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause a recession , it has come at a time when GDP is at its weakest in 10 years . If the RBA was negative enough on the conditions , it could be seen as just one more reason to move rates . However , while there is a short-term impact , If past natural disasters are anything to go by we should see this be a positive for GDP in the next few quarters as higher investment will occur across the regions that have been hit by the bushfires ( refer to Chart 19 ) . <p> On top of this we see a fiscal response to the affected regions as the more appropriate policy measure as it means the help required will land where it is needed most , rather than lower rates benefitting the country at large . <p> As such , we think that the RBA should not react to the fires , as the medium term effects will be limited and it is more appropriate for a fiscal ( rather than monetary ) policy response . <p> The other consideration here is whether the RBA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say about the future for potential policy action . If the RBA simply cuts interest rates every time a national disaster occurs , it has the potential to shirk the responsibilities of the government in addressing the effects of the rising temperatures and will potentially go around democratic process if voters demand environmental action . While it remains up to the RBA as to how they react to this outcome , the future forecasts for Australia 's weather could mean that cutting in the face of a natural disaster potentially sets them up for additionally easier policy in the future -- a slippery slope if these conditions occur more frequently . <h> Putting it together <p> Overall , we believe there is a higher probability that the RBA will be able to remain on hold this year , rather than cut rates . Yes , there are still near-term risks and the economic data is currently soft , but the employment indicators have been strong , inflation is more likely to be higher in 2020 than 2019 , the Chinese trade situation has shown signs of improving , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why the market is forecasting additional rate cuts , it is beginning to look like they are pricing in far more action from the RBA than will be warranted in 2020 , and there are improving odds that the RBA will end up on hold . <h> Want to learn more ? <p> The above wire was a summary of our recent white paper " 5 big questions the RBA needs to answer " .

The next in line can continue to pass it on . The incubation period is so long that people may not know where or when they picked it up . <p> Details that emerged last week about the new virus from China show how challenging it could be to control this outbreak , health experts say . <p> At first , some were relieved that the virus has n't proved fatal as often as those that caused SARS , Ebola or some other recent menaces . Now there 's worry that it still might cause a lot of deaths if it spreads far more than those other viruses did . <p> " The level of concern has been growing " with the new revelations about viral spread , said Marc Lipsitch of Harvard 's School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least 14,000 people since it was first detected in central China in late December . It has killed more than 300 and spread to about two dozen countries although most , like the United States , have few cases . <p> " We still have a low risk to the American public , but we want to keep it at a low risk , " the National Institutes of Health 's infectious disease chief , Dr. Anthony Fauci , said Friday at a news conference where quarantines and temporary travel bans were announced . <p> Several factors about the virus itself affect how bad the outbreak might become . <p> MULTIPLYING INFECTIONS <p> Based on the first 425 confirmed cases in China , each infection led to 2.2 others on average , Chinese scientists reported last week in the New England Journal of Medicine . That 's a bit more than ordinary flu but less than SARS , a genetic cousin of the new virus . <p> " It sounds and looks as if it 's going to be a very highly transmissible virus , " said Robert Webster , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hospital who has studied many outbreaks . <p> Whether the new virus will weaken as it spreads or instead become better at it is n't known . <p> " This virus may still be learning what it can do , " Webster said . " We do n't know its full potential yet . " <p> SPREADING IN STEALTH <p> The biggest worry is sustained transmission , where one person spreads the virus to another and that person continues to pass it on . A related concern is how often people with no symptoms are infecting others . <p> On Thursday , scientists reported that a Chinese woman who was not ill at the time spread the virus to a man in Germany during a business trip there , and that he in turn infected several other coworkers before showing any symptoms . A child of one of the workers also is infected now . <p> This so-called asymptomatic transmission " puts a terrible burden on the screening process , " which has heavily relied on symptoms to detect cases and track close contacts to limit spread , Fauci said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to person or without causing symptoms , " it will spread further and perhaps for longer than we initially hoped , " said Dr. Ashish Jha , a Harvard University global health professor . <p> DEATH RATE <p> The mortality rate looks like 2% to 3% but could be much lower if many mild cases or infections with no symptoms are going undetected , Fauci said . <p> SARS proved fatal in about 10% of cases . The flu 's mortality rate is only 0.1% , yet it kills hundreds of thousands around the world each year because it infects millions , Lipsitch noted . So the size of the outbreak can matter as much as the lethality of the virus in terms of how many deaths ultimately occur , he said . <p> INCUBATION PERIOD <p> Chinese scientists estimate the average incubation period to be roughly five days , but said it could last up to two weeks . <p> Such a long potential incubation period can be a problem , Webster said . <p> " People can move away from where they contracted it and not even remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> TESTING GAPS <p> It 's still a struggle to determine who is or is not infected . The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a test , but lacks enough confidence in its accuracy to make it widely available . Too little is known about possible methods -- throat or nose swabs versus blood or other samples -- and how many false alarms or missed cases each might give at any point in time . <p> " If we had an absolutely accurate test that was very sensitive and very specific , then we could just test people and say , ' OK , we 're good to go , ' " Fauci said at the news conference . " We do n't know the accuracy of this test .

It resisted travel bans in lieu of warning people to avoid nonessential travel to China and screening passengers from China at 20 international airports . Its decision Friday to deny entry to non-nationals who have recently traveled to China and quarantine Americans who are returning from that country marks a significant , and potentially counterproductive , escalation in the U.S. response to the coronavirus crisis . <p> Although this may assuage critics who insisted that the administration take more aggressive action , history and epidemiology warn us that such measures are unlikely to work .

After a federal court , in a rare example of judicial intervention during a public health panic , struck down that measure , the city established a quarantine around a neighborhood where many Chinese residents lived , enforcing it only against Chinese residents . That quarantine was also found to be unconstitutionally discriminatory . Decades later , HIV similarly provoked discrimination against groups perceived to be at the highest risk . As children such as Ryan White were kept out of school and well-known commentators demanded widespread quarantine , the Coast Guard picked up asylum-seeking Haitians and quarantined them at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba . Given that HIV was already widespread , as Judy Rabinovitz , a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union , noted at the time , " there can be no pretense that this can be to the public health benefit of the United States .

Despite assurances by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that blood and other bodily fluids were the primary modes of transmission , the news media fueled public fear about casual transmission . Governors responded by quarantining travelers who exhibited no symptoms of Ebola . Although she was not infected , Kaci Hickox , a nurse , was involuntarily detained in a tent outside Newark International Airport after arriving from West Africa , where she had treated patients . After Hickox told her story to the media , New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie ( R ) allowed her to travel to Maine , where state officials sought to quarantine her . A federal court later dismissed her constitutional challenge to New Jersey 's actions , and a federal court in Connecticut likewise dismissed a case brought by several people quarantined in that state .

In 2017 , the CDC published new federal quarantine regulations . Federal law had long given CDC broad powers to restrict international and interstate travel and apprehend and detain people who are thought to have a quarantinable disease ( a designation established by presidential order ) . Despite the breadth of that authority , the CDC had generally left infection control , at least within the country , to state and local health departments . Indeed , the CDC 's own prior quarantine regulations were remarkably thin , offering little guidance as to when and how the agency should exercise its authority . The updated regulations provide far greater specificity , authorizing the CDC to collect detailed information about travelers ' health status , and detain or bar travel ( including interstate travel ) of people who have -- or are " reasonably believed " to be infected with -- a quarantinable disease .

Critics , including one of us , worried that the due-process review provisions were inadequate , allowing people to be detained for relatively long periods while the review proceeded . In addition , the regulations do not provide for review by an independent decision-maker . They also do not limit detentions and travel bans to situations in which they are the least restrictive alternative , a standard that some courts have held to be constitutionally compelled . Also absent are protections from deportation and income replacement for people who are quarantined . Both protections may be critical to ensuring that people are willing to comply rather than seek to evade quarantine orders . In addition to these lapses , the regulations have few safeguards to prevent federal officials from wielding their public health powers in ineffective , potentially abusive ways .

" China has a history in the past , of course , of clamming up when it wants to . " <p> Dr. Mackenzie questioned why Chinese authorities appeared to delay reporting an increase in infections in the first half of January .

" <p> Mr. Green concludes : " Whilst I am confident that we 'll narrowly avoid a global recession in 2020 , no-one can accurately predict the future -- as we have seen with coronavirus , which markets wrongly assumed would be limited to mainly China . <p> " Therefore , in the current volatile environment , investors -- including myself -- will be revising their portfolios and drip-feeding new money into the market to take advantage of the opportunities whilst reducing risk at the same time .
