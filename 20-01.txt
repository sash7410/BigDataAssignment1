Who 's working , who 's not , and what 's been the effect of cases that are already in the pipeline ? <p> Dana Leigh Marks : <p> It 's been a devastating impact to have our immigration courts shut down , Amna . <p> You 're well aware of the tremendous backlog . And the only judges who are working are those who are hearing cases of individuals who are held in custody by the immigration officials . All of the non-detained cases in courts , which are the vast majority of our dockets , are on hold for the indefinite future . <p> Amna Nawaz : <p> And so we know some of these cases can already take years to unfold . What does it mean for the future of those cases ? <p> Dana Leigh Marks : <p> It 's very difficult to make that assessment . <p> I know , for me in San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over 4,000 cases . So many of the cases that are being canceled for the shutdown have been on my docket already for two or three or four years , and now I have no time in the foreseeable future to reset them . <p> It could be another three or four years before those people can expect hearings on their cases . <p> Amna Nawaz : <p> So we heard about that backlog . That is now at a record high . And if you take a look at those numbers , those have been going up rapidly over the last 10 years . <p> I guess the basic question is , how did we get here ? <p> Dana Leigh Marks : <p> Well , it has been a long time in coming through both Democratic and Republican administrations . <p> While there has been a big focus on immigration enforcement , there has not been sufficient focus to the immigration court system .

The government has said , the vast majority of those are n't with merit , that , ultimately , these are not granted asylum . <p> And so I guess my question is , if they can find a way to limit the number of cases coming to your court , would n't that help to alleviate the backlog ? <p> Dana Leigh Marks : <p> It 's not quite that simple , Amna . <p> It is a very complicated assessment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I describe it as being like a 1,000-piece puzzle , and you have to have every piece visible . <p> So in order to determine whether or not someone is eligible , Congress has decided that these people are entitled to a hearing before an immigration judge , so that the proper legal analysis can be applied to their case . <p> That 's what our law provides and , frankly , that 's what international treatise that we are signatories of require of us . So it would require a change in the governing law , not just a change in policy , in order to try to make a big impact on those kinds of cases . <p> Amna Nawaz : <p> Judge Marks , there is an argument made by the administration that our legal process has built into it loopholes , that people coming who apply for asylum end up staying for years because of the pace and the backlog , and that makes it harder when their cases are ultimately denied to get them out of the country . <p> What do you say to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firmly believes that everyone is entitled to their day in court , and that it should occur in a reasonably prompt amount of time . <p> But the reason that there are delays in our system is simply because we have been underfunded and ignored for so long .

There was a man back there in that region but he hit it well enough . <p> Kevin Pietersen thought it was a bit risky - he tells Talksport listeners that Denly is always playing Maharaj off the front foot , meaning that he can not rotate the strike , so he has to take on the big shot . " It is a technical flaw . He does not have the ability to rotate the strike so he has to play the release shot . And any slight miscalculation and that is out . There 's only one boundary fielder on - and he is in that area .

So something to build on there . <p> England meanwhile will , I think , be enjoying their luncheon : a decent morning 's work .

Denly 's defence holds firm though and that 's lunch . <p> 60 runs from the session , mainly for England after they knocked off those two South African wickets early courtesy of a certain evergreen James Anderson . Zak Crawley looked promising but he fell for 25 . A learning curve for him . <h> OVER 16 : 48/1 ( Denly 5* Sibley 18* ) <p> It 's a bit flat here as we meander to lunch . South Africa have been unable to turn the screw after that wicket as England gradually rebuild . The complexities of Test cricket and why it is so intriguing . <p> Oh that 's a bit of excitement as a shorter one from Nortje bounces past the ducking Denly 's chin . A couple of singles before Sibley confidently finds the gap in the field backward of square to notch up a further four runs . <h> OVER 15 : 43/1 ( Denly 4* Sibley 14* ) <p> Rabada is done bowling for now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pretorius for lbw , especially as Sibley is rubbing his elbow and replays clearly show the ball hitting his funny bone . <p> Sibley responds with a lovely boundary through mid-wicket off a fuller delivery . <h> State of play <h> OVER 10 : 27/0 ( Crawley 25* Sibley 2* ) <p> Anrich Nortje into the attack for South Africa , replacing Philander . <p> Nortje finds a crack straight away , with an edge from Crawley flying over the vacant gully for a boundary . That 's more controlled from Crawley a few balls later , getting the levers working to crack it out towards forward of square leg . Superb fielding from Pretorius stops the boundary and keeps it to two runs . <p> A swing and a miss and then a solid drive straight to mid off finishes of the over and brings up drinks . <h> OVER 8 : 21/0 ( Crawley 19* Sibley 2* ) <p> Philander , into his fourth over , tries to entice Crawley into a shot but he is not tempted . The South African drew the opener into an outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Again he shoulders arms and does n't give anything away on the next couple either .

A good response from the Kent man . <h> OVER 5 : 12/0 ( Crawley 10* Sibley 2* ) <p> Ouch ! Crawley attempts the pull shot but the ball hits his arm and then ricochets right up into his grille .

Another confidence-booster for the newbie opener as he drives straight back down the ground for another boundary . <p> Eeeek ! All that good work nearly undone as he looks to drive again but is a touch early and the ball squirts under his bat , narrowly missing the stumps . <h> South Africa 223 all out ( trail England by 46 runs ) <p> Whatever England ate for breakfast clearly did the trick , with South Africa dismissed in under half an hour .

They could have had the innings wrapped up there . <p> Philander , eager to get the runs , goes for a single that is really not on after slicing to gully . Nortje is stranded but Pope 's effort fails to hit the wickets . Anderson then sends a jaffa down , seaming away off a good length , which nearly catches out Nortje . <p> After holding firm off the next two , the tailender then clips down to the boundary to relieve the pressure and blocks the last . <h> OVER 86 : 216/9 ( Philander 14* Nortje 0* ) <p> Barmy Army understandably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broad gets his first action of the day from the Wynberg End . <p> Pressure on Philander certainly now to try and eek out some crucial runs for South Africa after that first over . That 's not the way to do it though as he wafts at one outside off and fails to connect . Ugly . He does manage to punch one through the off side to leave Nortje to face the final delivery which he shoulders arms to . <h> Nearly time for play to start <p> Vernon Philander would love to sign off his Newlands swansong on a winning note . He will be called upon with the ball later but first there are matters to attend to with the bat , with the South African 13 not out . The all-rounder is moving to Somerset this year . <p> Joining him at the crease today though is Kagiso Rabada . What can the hosts add to their overnight tally ? Jimmy Anderson warming up for the first over . <h> Early cloud cover <p> Even with one of the stands under construction , it really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much to tick off the bucket list I 'd say .

I 'm told no rain forecast for today , despite the early cloud . <h> Good morning <p> And welcome to day three of the second Test in Cape Town . <p> As our cricket correspondent in Cape Town , Scyld Berry , wrote at the close of play yesterday , there 's ' life in the old dogs yet ' . He was , of course , referring to England 's top two Test wicket-takers James Anderson and Stuart Broad who helped England turn a wicket-less second session into a highly profitable third one to help the tourists forge a path back into the series . Together they took five wickets for only 70 runs to give England every chance of yet winning this match - and series . Not bad for players who were at the risk of being dropped if a certain Jofra Archer had been fit . <p> In plain numbers , South Africa reached 215-8 at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 269 all out . As well as the contributions of veteran fast bowlers Anderson and Broad , 21-year-old seamer Sam Curran and 22-year-old spinner Dom Bess both made important breakthroughs into the South Africa attack . It also represented a day to cheer finally for Joe Root who has seen his captaincy come under serious scrutiny lately during a difficult tour full of illness and injury . " We reaped the rewards towards the end of the day , " Curran said afterwards . " No wickets in the middle session but we knew the rewards would come if we stuck at it ... I think all in all a good day . Hopefully we can bat big and try and win this game . " <p> The first task this morning for England , however , will be snaffling those final two wickets , preferably nice and quickly before South Africa gain parity . But even if the hosts do nudge ahead , with a pitch starting to show variable bounce and some sideways movement off widening cracks , batting last here will be a tough task , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their second innings . Although with England 's batting patterns of late , that is always a big if . A match-deciding day ahead .

@@41667041 <p> It 's the last Davos Playbook for 2020 , and what a week it 's been . Playbook 's Rym Momtaz and Ryan Heath share their Davos takeaways below . But first , what everyone 's talking about this morning : U.S. financier George Soros ' bombshells . <h> DRIVING THE DAY <p> SHOTS ACROSS THE BOW : " Facebook will work to reelect U.S. President Donald Trump and Trump will protect Facebook , " said Soros in prepared remarks at a dinner Thursday night . He described Trump as " a conman and the ultimate narcissist ... whose politics are a malignant disease , " and Xi Jinping , as a " dictator . " Greta Thunberg got praise . Playbook 's Ryan Heath and Stephen Brown have more . <p> CRITICAL THINKING : Soros ' concern for the 2020 U.S. presidential election and the Western liberal order are seeing him double down on his philanthropic work : He announced he 's investing $1 billion in funding " critical thinking " via a new network of colleges in Europe , which will expand on his Central European University . It is the " most important project " of his life , as Soros put it . <p> SOROS VERBATIM : The U.S. , China and Russia are in the hands of " actual or would-be dictators , " Soros said . And also : " It is now easier to influence than to understand events . " <p> UK NOT A RULE TAKER : Sajid Javid , the only member of Boris Johnson 's Cabinet authorized to break the U.K. government ban on sipping " Champagne with billionaires " in Davos , caught up with Playbook Thursday . Drinking coffee rather than bubbly , the chancellor stuck to his guns on a tight year-end schedule for a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU , and elaborated on his comments last week that companies should get used to the idea that the U.K. will not align with the EU 's single market or customs union . " We wo n't diverge for its own sake -- but we wo n't be a rule taker , " Javid said . <p> STILL AT IT : Still in Davos , Greta Thunberg is leading another one of her regular protests at 11 a.m . <p> DRIVING NEXT WEEK : Forget Davos , it 's Alfalfa time , baby . " That 's an annual black-tie gathering where current and past players in the nation 's capital invite corporate titans to join them for a dinner and satirical roasts , " writes POLITICO 's John Harris . " The Davos-Alfalfa pairing serves as a kind of unofficial launch of what is now a yearlong season of corporate and political networking among a certain set of the world 's most influential people . " <h> DAVOS TAKEAWAYS <p> THE ROOKIE TAKE , FROM A FIRST-TIMER : Via Playbook 's Rym Momtaz ... <p> 1 . Speaking truth to power is not the brief . Between WEF Chairman Klaus Schwab 's saccharine remarks after Trump 's speech , and a CEO telling us that Greta Thunberg was needed in Davos to balance out the conversation , Playbook got the distinct impression that the WEF this year was a gathering of rich white dudes hiding behind a 17-year-old girl holding the U.S. president to account . <p> 2 . Continental Europe is a bit player . Sure , Ursula von der Leyen drew a big crowd for her inaugural Davos appearance as the European Commission president , but European Parliament chief David Sassoli was an also-ran , and German Chancellor Angela Merkel 's keynote barely registered in conversations . American and British corporations dominated , but their Continental fellows were far less visible . " It 's a cultural difference issue , " one WEF official reckoned . <p> 3 . Lack of diversity is a glaring problem . Aside from official political delegations , you 'd be hard-pressed to find a non-Western , non-male participant . And initiatives like the Female Quotient Equality Lounge , while improving the female presence , also highlight just how outside the nucleus of power ( embodied by the Congress Center ) they remain . <p> 4 . Why are we here again ? Sure , the world 's big-hitters in one place at the same time is a big deal . But this high school reunion for CEOs still feels like a relic from a different time : no audience participation , an exclusionary pecking order , and people networking , yes , but largely in their own circles . <p> THE VETERAN TAKE , FROM AN 8-TIMER : Here 's how Ryan Heath saw things ... <p> 1 . The global elite has priced in President Trump -- they now shrug rather than gasp . Most galling for the U.S. president : a 17-year-old is better at driving the day . <p> 2 . The WEF channeled nearly every conversation toward climate action and sustainability . That was made easier because going green is now profitable a lot of the time . <p> 3 . The future U.K. king is no mere ribbon-cutter : Prince Charles had more political impact here than the whole U.K. government -- and also more than former PM Theresa May , who did n't let her brutal opinion of Davos-goers being " citizens of nowhere " stop her from taking their money ( to speak at a private dinner ) . <p> 4 . Real debate and real inclusion make for better panels ; fake consensus bores . WEF will need to apply that to its official stages if it wants the Congress Center to get its mojo back in 2021 . <p> Channel the fig leaf : Also on the podcast , Stephen Brown discusses Trump and Twitter with Mary Beard , professor of classics at the University of Cambridge . She tells Stephen she was criticized on Twitter for being a token participant in Davos . But even " if you are the fig leaf , " you can " fight back , " she said . " Fig leaves do change things . " She continued : " A little bit of cynicism about Davos is definitely called for , but being too cynical I think misses the way that institutions are made to change by outsiders . " <h> BRINGING IN THE HRYVNIA <p> THE NEW NANNY STATE : Ukraine 's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy pitched investors in Davos Thursday -- via video -- with an innovative offer : a government nanny of one 's own . " For those who invest more than $100 million , we will conclude a direct investment agreement with the state , based on the English law . These investors will receive a personal tutor -- a nanny -- from the government , speaking five languages and available on a 24/7 basis to take care of all your issues . " <p> Tax holiday : Zelenskiy 's second proposal is to " provide investors who privatize state-owned enterprises worth $10 million or more in the next two years with a five-year tax holiday . " <p> A threat or a promise ? " Not investing in Ukraine is akin to being George Bell who refused to buy Google for $1 million in 1999 ! So , do not miss out Ukraine , " Zelenskiy concluded . Let it rain hryvnia ! <h> IT AI N'T LOOKIN ' GOOD <p> FALLING SHORT : For all the Davos talk on climate change , corporate commitments and social pressure , the rhetoric still fell far short of the action needed , Columbia University 's Jason Bordoff tweeted . And he told Bloomberg : " Policy is nowhere near the level of rhetoric and ambition -- that was the theme last year , and it 's even more so this year . " <p> WOKING UP : The question is whether all the do-good pledges and globo-speak are actually just globo-bull . It 's not clear that corporations are ready to meet the high expectations they have set among governments and advocates alike , write Stephen Brown and John Harris . <p> HEAD-DESK MOMENT : Asked by the male moderator on a panel on gender balance how a governing coalition with five female leaders works , Finland 's 34-year-old Prime Minister Sanna Marin shot back , " It works like any other government . We do n't need a special meeting room or something . " <p> -- Which illustratesjust how far the world still is from gender parity . And it 's not just a feeling : We 're 257 years away , according to a WEF prediction . Check out POLITICO 's Women Rule podcast here for more . <p> BUT BUT BUT : Areije al Shakar , who heads the Bahrain Al Waha Fund of Funds , sees an upside from the lack of women . She told Playbook : " At least I 'm here ... Sometimes it helps because you stand out , you 're able to manoeuver because there are n't as many blue suits . The novelty comes when you 're a female that 's leading a fund-of-funds -- we 're a rarity . " <p> SDG TROUBLE : " The business community is not moving at the speed or scale needed to deliver the sustainable development goals , " warned Lise Kingo , CEO and executive director of the U.N . Global Compact , on Thursday . To counter that , U.N . Secretary-General Ant ? nio Guterres launched " SDG Ambition " in Davos , supported by SAP and Accenture , to help companies and other organizations incorporate sustainability and the SDGs into their business operations and to measure and manage their performance . <p> **With the odds of a recession in the US rising , geopolitical shifts and trade wars changing the economic landscape and more , economic uncertainty has become the backdrop for European business .

The WEF initiative is being set up with initial financial support from Marc and Lynne Benioff ( of Salesforce ) . But Playbook ca n't help but wonder , how effective will the program be , when major banks continue investing in fossil fuels ? <p> SNAP ! One tweep shared this description of Davos : " Billionaires telling millionaires how the middle class should live . " ( h/t Mariana Mazzucato ) <p> GET YOUR CHECKBOOKS 2 : Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis caught up with Playbook ahead of his panel appearance . It 's not his first WEF , but it 's been a while : Last time he was here , he was still a venture capitalist . Now , he 's just after capital . Davos " is an opportunity to engage with the business community , to talk about what I consider a very successful first six months in terms of changing the perception of the country abroad , " Mitsotakis said . " The economy is growing rapidly ... under the new government , Greece is open for business and a very attractive destination for foreign capital to invest . " <p> MORE TECH TAX TALK : After a meeting between French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire , U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and OECD Secretary-General ? ngel Gurr ? a on Wednesday , Le Maire confirmed key elements of a provisional tech tax truce , but said the basis for international talks at the OECD level -- which is the heart of the matter and will determine whether an international or a national tax will have to be levied -- still had to be ironed out . They are meeting again today to do so . <p> **A message from Goldman Sachs : Goldman Sachs believes sustainable finance is where the world is going -- it 's no longer on the sidelines , but increasingly core to a company 's business . That 's why sustainability has become a firmwide mandate with a focus on climate transition and inclusive growth . Learn more about the firm 's sustainable finance efforts. ** <p> EUROPE GETS DEFENSIVE : Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the WEF on Wednesday that Europe needs credible military capabilities . Former NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen fully agrees : " If you do not have a military strength , then people will not listen to you . It is as simple as that , " he told Davos Confidential 's Cristina Gonzalez . <p> CASH AI-GHT , EUROPE SO TIGHT : This afternoon at the TechPark Davos conference , German artificial intelligence business incubator Merantix will announce it has raised ? 25 million to found up to eight new AI startups in Berlin over the coming four years , Janosch Delcker reports for POLITICO Technology Pros . Merantix 's co-founder Adrian Locher told Janosch his company had tried to collect investment from private institutional investors in Europe such as pension funds , but " to this day , this proves to be very difficult , particularly when it comes to early-stage investment . " <h> HE CAME , HE SPOKE , THEY SHRUGGED <p> MEH FEST : " Two years ago U.S. President Donald Trump flew here and took the gathering of elites at the World Economic Forum by storm , " POLITICO 's co-founder John Harris , Florian Eder and Ryan Heath write this morning . " Every conversation seemed to revolve around the American leader and his signature brand of political disruption . Trump came back this year , and was greeted with a shrug . " <p> TALK OF THE TOWN ? In his closing press conference on Wednesday , Trump said everyone around Davos was talking about how well the U.S. economy was doing . That 's not exactly what Playbook has been hearing . One Eastern European white-badge-holder asks : " Did I miss something , or did Trump not mention the EU in his speech ? Was he really only talking about European cathedrals ? " <p> VOTING WITH THEIR HANDSHAKES : The U.K. may be angling for a doubly special relationship with the U.S. post Brexit , but at least two major British figures are publicly defying Trump by showing support for his teenage arch nemesis Greta Thunberg . <p> And the guv : Bank of England Governor Mark Carney also backed Thunberg in her clash with Trump , contrasting her contribution to tackling the climate emergency with the White House 's less helpful approach . Read it at the Guardian . <p> TRUMP CONCEDES ... that Greta has done ( at least ) one thing better than him : " She beat me out on Time magazine , " he said at his press conference , after being told she was only 17 years old . <h> DISCONNECTED DAVOS <p> CURIOUS : Who 's best placed to speak about the 90-plus-day protests in Lebanon ? Must be the politician Lebanese protesters loathe the most , caretaker Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil , who is on a panel later this afternoon . To protestors , Bassil embodies the height of nepotism and corruption in an already crowded field of Lebanese politicians . <p> Remember me ? Bassil is the guy who bragged at last year 's WEF about giving lessons to the U.S. and U.K. about " running a country without a budget . " Playbook wonders where exactly Bassil was running his country into ... <p> COME AGAIN ? Big Davos day for Brazil Wednesday , with Economy Minister Paulo Guedes vaunting its " stable democracy " and " complete environment of good opportunities to investors around the world , " as the EU Ambassador to Brasilia put it . He can count on one big supporter , at least : the U.S. <p> Reality check : How does Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro 's flouting of his climate commitments on the Amazon jive with all the talk about climate action and sustainability we have been hearing from the WEF and CEOs all week ? <p> COME AGAIN 2 ? At times laughing and smiling , the Beijing-backed Chief Executive of Hong Kong Carrie Lam said on Wednesday that she had to stay on as leader to tackle an economic crisis and the coronavirus , which has killed 17 people in mainland China . Reuters has the write-up . <h> OH WHAT A NIGHT <p> If you decided to stay in on Wednesday , you really missed out . Fear not , Playbook 's spies fanned out across town and the night delivered some pretty ... uncensored ... moments . <p> RESISTANCE : A drunk and obstinate party-goer at the FT/CNBC bash was seen being physically ejected from the venue . But he so adamantly wanted to stay , he put his feet up against the closed door . <p> TOP DRAWCARD:Jane Goodall wins the Rockstar Cach ? Award , and we have a feeling she will be hard to dethrone . Playbook spotted many white-badge-holders lining up for selfies at the Hard Rock Hotel , where Goodall was Wednesday . <p> SPOTTED 1 : Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai at Davos House until 1:30 a.m. -- we hope he did n't have an early breakfast meeting ! <p> ANGLING FOR THAT DAMEHOOD : Theresa May told her audience at a PwC dinner Wednesday night that the most interesting person she met as British prime minister was the queen . One British Davos-goer exclaimed to Playbook : " She is so vanilla ! " <p> SALT ON SORE WOUNDS : Apparently it is n't enough to wrangle Apple chief Tim ( or Timothy , as his badge reads ) Cook for a selfie on the promenade -- someone actually asked him for one and whipped out their Samsung Galaxy phone to take it . <p> OVERHEARD 1 : At the Journal House from one proud white badge to another : " I 've already slept with half of my consultants . Time to go home . " <p> OVERHEARD 2 : A Brit surveying the scene at a party : " Wow , it 's like the dying embers of multilateral liberalism in here . " <p> HIGHLIGHTING HEALTH WORKERS : Johnson &amp; Johnson 's Paul Stoffels , GAVI CEO Seth Berkley and International Rescue Committee 's David Miliband hosted a press conference at 11.45 a.m. at the WEF media center on the key role of health workers in the fight against global epidemics in light of an ongoing Ebola outbreak in Africa and the emerging threat of coronavirus in China and around the world . <h> INSIDE DAVOS <p> SHUTTLE DIPLOMACY : The WEF shuttle buses are a great way of getting to know people , as we 've previously pointed out . The forced proximity in crawling peak-hour traffic has produced some fascinating chance encounters this week , improving our familiarity with subjects ranging from AI to street art and Indian politics . Favorite comments so far : " My CEO is speaking -- I have to be there ! " and " He 's not my president ! " <p> THUMBS DOWN ... to the rude people who have taken to literally pushing others on the sidewalks of Davos in order to get past them -- which has happened twice in two days for Playbook . And to those crowding others at security lines , pretending not to see them -- twice in one day for Playbook as well . These people clearly did n't get the memo that at Davos , everyone with a badge is supposed to be equal . ( Of course , no badge , no care . ) <p> THE PRICE IS RIGHT : If you want to create your own lounge space in the Belvedere Hotel , you can expect to pay $3 million and up for the week . The bare minimum for a Promenade shopfront is $150,000 , excluding the cost of any renovations . <p> BY THE NUMBERS : One Belvedere Hotel corporate occupant said they 'd experienced a 20-percent drop in attendance at their events in 2020 . That 's the good news : Fewer hangers-on via the hotel badge system means our source is happier with the quality of their guest list . <h> WHAT YOU ( MAY HAVE ) MISSED <p> Peek inside the mind of Jamie Dimon , the world 's most powerful banker , who told folks at the Equality Lounge Wednesday evening : " My mom was a women 's libber " ... " More than half of my direct reports are women " ... " Leaders should say ' hi ' to everyone at the table . " <p> The Mooch : " I am 100 percent traumatized " by being fired from the White House , Anthony Scaramucci admitted to Playbook 's own Rym Momtaz during a panel she was moderating Wednesday afternoon . <p> SPOTTED : The Mooch getting raked over the coals by WEF security for having so many hair products in his bag as he went through screening . <p> YOUR TIRED BONES : Palantir is n't satisfied with amazing free coffee -- it also had a masseuse at its Wednesday cocktail session . Best way to soothe that ski soreness . <h> DO N'T MISS TODAY <p> SIDE EVENT : Blockchain conference at the Intercontinental , called CV Summit . <p> MIND AND BODY : The Consciousness Retreat at 2:30 p.m. , which promises to arm you with nothing less than " the right tools to fix personal , professional or planetary challenges . " <p> HOT TICKETS:Lenny Kravitz at Salesforce ... Jason Derulo at Cloudflare ... Yo-Yo Ma at an LGBTQ dinner by GLAAD and the Ariadne Getty Foundation ... There 's also the mysterious prospect of a Lady Gaga appearance at an undisclosed party . <p> SKI REPORT : The subzero chill overnight is helping maintain the powder on the slopes despite the sunshine and warmer temps during the day . High of 6C today . <p> **A message from Goldman Sachs : Over the next 10 years , Goldman Sachs will target $750 billion of financing , investing and advisory activity to nine areas that focus on climate transition and inclusive growth . Because , at Goldman Sachs , they believe sustainable finance is where the world is going -- it is no longer on the sidelines , but increasingly core to a company 's business . As part of this push , Goldman Sachs is committed to helping clients position themselves for a future in which sustainability is core to all industries and integrated across markets -- making sustainable finance a firmwide mandate , to achieve an inclusive , low-carbon economy . Learn more about Goldman Sachs ' newly announced sustainable finance goal. ** <p> It 's Day 4 of POLITICO 's Davos Playbook . European leaders get prime billing today . If you 're a meat lover , you may want to pack your ham sandwich ( more on that a bit further down ) . <h> DRIVING THE DAY <p> MORE TRUMP : The U.S. president is holding a press conference . Watch here . <p> VDL TAKES THE STAGE : European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had her big Davos moment this morning , and she used it to send the message that the " geopolitical " focus for her new EU Commission means a new emphasis on hard power . " Europe needs credible military capabilities and we have set up the building blocks of a European defense mechanism -- it is complementary to NATO and it is different , " she said . <p> Playbook reality check : It 's unclear how von der Leyen plans on bringing her home country along for the NATO/defense ride : Germany ( where she was defense minister ! ) constantly refuses to flex its muscle . <p> Stepping up : " To be more assertive in the world , we know we must step up in some fields , " von der Leyen said . She acknowledged the EU had at times been caught flat-footed in responding to geo-political conflicts -- and conceded that EU countries have at times been too divided on foreign policy , particularly on the conflict in Libya . " Libya shows the cost of division and hesitation , " she said , calling last weekend 's ceasefire talks in Berlin " an important step in the right direction , " and saying the " Commission will strongly support reconciliation and reconstruction . " <p> Quotable : " It takes very little power to break a fragile balance , but the true power lies in putting the pieces back together again , " the Commission president said . <p> Message to Brexit Britain : Von der Leyen also used the opportunity to send a pointed message to the U.K. government of Boris Johnson , who instructed his ministers ( with the exception of Chancellor Sajid Javid ) to skip Davos : On the coming negotiations on the Political Declaration which will define the U.K. 's future relationship with the EU , von der Leyen said that while " shared values " will continue to unite the two , London should remember that " there is a difference whether you are a member state or not a member state where access to the single market is concerned . " <p> The money quote : " If it is the U.K. 's choice to be more distant to the EU , then there will be more distance where the single market is concerned , " VDL said . Mic drop . <p> NO JUSTICE LIKE TAX JUSTICE : In his Davos speech this morning , Spanish PM Pedro S ? nchez identified reestablishing social justice as a key challenge for Spain and Europe . " We live in prosperous societies which nevertheless have alarming levels of poverty , " he said , adding that tax avoidance is mentioned too rarely . " Let us not fool ourselves , " he continued , " there can not be social justice without tax justice . " <p> Echoing that message : Spain 's Deputy PM Nadia Calvi ? o , in an interview with CNBC . <p> GREEN PRINCE : Look out for the keynote speech from Prince Charles this afternoon at 2:40 p.m . The prince of Wales is a lifelong environmentalist , a philosophy he has put into practice throughout his Duchy of Cornwall ( which also happens to fund part of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle 's lives , but we do n't expect he will touch on that today ) . <h> THAT 'S AWKWARD <p> GROWING PAINS : It 's not every day that one gets to witness an intense exchange between the head honcho of the European Commission and their White House counterpart , but that 's the beauty of Davos , is n't it ? On Tuesday , Ursula von der Leyen had her first bilateral meeting with Trump since becoming Commission president -- an important moment for the new , geopolitical European Commission . But alas , there were no EU-side journalists there to see it . <p> He said , she said : The White House accused Commission staffers of failing to send the names of the journalists they wanted in the room to the U.S. team in advance ; Team VDL said they 'd never been asked to do so . But despite the fact WEF journalists undergo multiple levels of security screening , the White House would n't budge on its protocol . <h> TAXING TECH <p> TRUMP HUDDLES WITH TECH EXECS : Donald Trump had breakfast today with business leaders and tech executives including Apple CEO Tim Cook , Microsoft boss Satya Nadella and Salesforce chief Marc Benioff . Also in attendance : White House adviser and first daughter Ivanka Trump , Director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow , and the U.S. secretaries of labor , transportation , commerce and treasury . <p> THE BACKDROP : The tech industry has a lot to celebrate after the Trump administration reached an agreement with France to pause plans for a digital services tax on U.S. giants including Facebook and Google , while the two sides and the OECD try to hammer out a longer term deal . ( The deal underscores how the industry continues to rack up major policy victories in Washington on trade , taxes and more . Bjarke Smith-Meyer has more on this . ) <p> QUOTABLE : " Trade truce is not the same as trade peace -- trade peace is what we should be aiming for , " said IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva on a panel this morning . <p> WHAT ABOUT THE BRITS ? Mnuchin was on a panel alongside U.K. Chancellor Sajid Javid this morning . Asked about Britain 's own planned digital tax , he said : " We will be having some private conversations ... and I am sure the president Trump and Boris Johnson will be talking on it as well , as the president did with President Macron . " He added ominously : " We think the digital tax is discriminatory in nature . If people want to just arbitrarily put taxes on our digital companies , we will consider arbitrarily putting taxes on car companies . " <p> The Saj unrattled : " We plan to go ahead with our digital services tax in April , " Javid said , adding that it would be " proportionate " and " temporary , " and " it will fall away once there is an international solution . " <p> In conclusion : " We all agree that something needs to happen and it should be done in an international way , " Mnuchin said . " This year could be that year of change . " <h> MORE TECH ( BECAUSE IN DAVOS YOU CAN NEVER HAVE ENOUGH ) <p> DID MBS HACK BEZOS ? A bombshell revelation overnight from the Guardian , and it 's a Davos trifecta : Saudi Arabia ( which will host the G20 this year and is out in force in Davos ) , Big Tech and a billionaire . " The Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos had his mobile phone ' hacked ' in 2018 after receiving a WhatsApp message that had apparently been sent from the personal account of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia , " according to the Guardian . " The encrypted message from the number used by Mohammed bin Salman is believed to have included a malicious file that infiltrated the phone of the world 's richest man , according to the results of a digital forensic analysis ... Large amounts of data were exfiltrated from Bezos ' phone within hours . " Yikes . Perhaps a good conversation-starter over at the Saudi caf ? ? <p> 5G DINNER : Playbook 's Ryan Heath hosted a 5G-themed dinner Tuesday night ( under Chatham House rules ) , which generated passionate views on the way forward for the transformative technology . There 's lots of work ahead to beat a possible urban/rural divide , and to communicate that 5G is likely to be about much more than faster networks , but a way to connect all things , with big security and privacy implications . People want 5G networks built by domestic or allied manufacturers -- a way forward on their trust concerns could be the virtualization of some parts of these networks . A POLITICO-Qualcomm survey across 12 markets will be published in the coming days . <p> PROTOCOL PREVIEW : Protocol , a new media company that will exclusively cover tech from POLITICO publisher Robert Allbritton , is hosting a pre-launch VIP breakfast on Thursday at Nasdaq 's space . The event features Protocol Editor-at-Large David Pierce , who 'll be chatting with analyst Benedict Evans on his tech predictions for 2020 . Registrations are closed and the guest list is packed with tech execs , so get there early to get a good seat . <h> WIDENING THE SCOPE <p> MINISTRY OF TRUTH UPDATES : WEF has launched a Davos Friends of Africa Growth Platform . The founding members are the presidents of Botswana and Ghana and the chairman of AngloGold Ashanti . The platform 's goal is to create 1 million jobs . <p> ON LGBTI RIGHTS : " I 'm the prime minister and I 'm also gay , " Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel told Playbook . " I think if people are here , they are here because of their profession -- it 's not the gay prime minister who is going to meet with the gay CEO of Apple , but Tim Cook is going to meet Xavier Bettel , and both are gay . And that 's cool . " For more sign up to our Davos Confidential podcast . <p> LISTEN TO THE BIG D : There is much talk about diversity , and how to make the corporate world more inclusive . CEO of Solvay Ilham Kadri shared her vision with Playbook via this morning 's Davos Confidential podcast : " Diversity for us is not only gender , it 's nationalities , it 's ethnicity , background , orientation , it 's diversity of thoughts , it 's the big D and when you have it in the room , you need to listen to it . " <h> FIGHTING THE MAN ? <p> BATTLE FOR . ORG : Some of the world 's biggest NGOs gathered at 11:45 a.m. this morning at the WEF Congress Center to protest the proposed sale of the top-level . org domain to a private equity firm . They say the non-commercial part of the internet -- the digital home of NGOs , nonprofits and civil society -- must remain in the hands of a nonprofit . Internet Society owns . org and wants to sell it to create a billion-dollar endowment for itself and its mission to protect the open internet . Global internet governance body ICANN is mulling whether to intervene to stop the sale . <p> OVERHEARD : A Playbooker hears there may have been a Burning Man party in Davos last night . We 're confused -- is n't Burning Man supposed to be anti-The Man , and is n't Davos as The Man as can be ? If you were there , get in touch -- we promise not to out you . <h> DAVOS INSIDER <p> VEGGIE DAY : It 's vegetarian and **27;250;TOOLONG menu day in the Congress Hall today -- for those who have been quick and lucky enough to identify both when and where the elusive food gets served . It 's part of the WEF 's sustainability push . Ninety percent of the food served during the forum is seasonal . <p> FORGET WHAT SHE SAID : Playbook can confirm that Theresa May will be joining the " citizens of nowhere " ( as she famously described globalists ) in Davos this week , and has been booked ( for goodness knows how much cash ) to speak at a dinner PWC is hosting tonight for business people and their clients . " The earnings will be declared in the normal way , " a May aide said . As POLITICO London Playbook 's Jack Blanchard points out , the former British PM did always enjoy a good mountain walk . <p> PEAK DAVOS : Who said Davos was just about lining one 's pockets -- or growing one 's rolodex to line one 's pockets ? There were two sessions this morning to mend your tired , burned-out souls . If you had three hours to spare , the first , held atop a nearby mountain , promised to help you " learn how to add more joy to your life . " If you were pressed for time , there was a more-manageable 30-minute meditation session led by Davos regular Sadhguru . Playbook could n't get to either because we were getting in place to attend panels on geopolitics and climate policy -- no rest for the wicked . But if you are so inclined , Sadhguru is leading another morning meditation session at 8:15 a.m . Thursday morning . <p> OVERHEARD : " One of the questions on the entrance test my 10-year-old had to take was whether his father has ? 48,000 for yearly tuition . " Unclear which is more mind boggling , that a 10-year-old 's boarding school should cost this much , or that a 10-year-old should know how much his father makes . Playbook did n't ask whether there was a question about the offspring 's mother 's earnings . <p> $34,000 : Speaking of expensive offspring , that 's how much vehicles rented by the U.S. Secret Service to shuttle Ivanka Trump around Davos for two days is costing taxpayers . The total price tag for the entire presidential delegation is over $4 million , according to Quartz , twice as expensive as Donald Trump 's first visit to Davos in 2018 . Playbook spotted the first daughter walking in the Congress Hall , and very few VIPs have elicited a similar commotion . Chinese journalists armed with phone-cameras tailed her , while CNN 's Jim Acosta attempted a question about her father 's impeachment . She remained unflappably mute . <p> OH MAMA : To be fair to the Trumps , Davos is a pricey place . Playbook , for instance , had a schnitzel at the Hotel Schatzalp that cost an eye-watering 56 Swiss francs ( around ? 52 or $57 ) , with undercooked and over-cucumbered potatoes . We 've had better schnitzel for a quarter of the price in a neighborhood caf ? in Vienna . <p> BIG FASHION DOES DAVOS : It had to happen : The Vogue Nightcap at Davos House was hosted by supermodel ( and philanthropist and angel investor ) Natalia Vodianova and Conde Nast Publishing Director Vanessa Kingori . The weirdest part ? Wesley Snipes requested salsa music only during the nightcap . <p> SKI REPORT : The last snowfall was Sunday and the temperatures are climbing , but Playbook ran into some lucky early risers hitting the slopes as we made our way to the Conference Hall . Today expect a high of 6C and sunny skies . <p> **A message from Goldman Sachs : At Goldman Sachs , sustainability is a firmwide mandate with a focus on the interconnected themes of climate transition and inclusive growth . The firm is committed to helping its clients position themselves for a future in which sustainability is core to all industries and integrated across markets . They will achieve this vision by doing what they do best -- invest , finance , advise , and innovate -- to drive global climate transition and inclusive growth strategies that accelerate positive change . That 's why Goldman Sachs is targeting $750 billion in sustainable finance growth themes by 2030 . Explore the firm 's newly announced sustainable finance goal. ** <p> Welcome back to the Davos Playbook , arriving a little later than expected today , just like U.S. President Donald Trump did . <h> DRIVING THE DAY <p> It 's top billing day in Davos -- just in case the constant stream of landing helicopters had n't clued you in already . And the special brand of WEF schizophrenia continues today : Youth climate activists are headlining panels while the world leader who occasionally mocks them gets the opening address . And it 's not the only contradiction of this forum , but more on that further below . <p> WHAT TRUMP HAD TO SAY : The U.S. president 's long-awaited Davos speech ( so long awaited , the WEF folks had to rope in some Swiss tenors in traditional dress to sing for the grumbling crowd ) was practically a love-letter to his Chinese counterpart , Xi Jinping . " He 's for China , I 'm for the U.S. , but other than that , we love each other , " Trump said when he took to the stage , 20 minutes behind schedule . ( Playbook side note : Before you pop your corks , let 's wait for the rest of the U.S.-China trade deal to be hammered out . ) <p> Trump 's two Davos messages ... <p> 1 . Got trade nerves ? Get used to it . Trump reckons his war-strategy is on the money , describing the deals he 's been making with China , Mexico , Canada and Greenland as " a new model for the 21st century . " <p> 2 . Chill out on climate change : Addressing the Greta of it all , Trump cheerfully said : " This is not a time for pessimism , " adding that " fear and doubt is not a good process , " and calling on folks to " reject the perennial prophets of doom . " But the U.S. president did indicate he wants to protect nature -- or in his words , " the majesty of God " -- his way , by committing to joining the initiative to plant 1 trillion trees . <p> Speaking of which : Before Trump 's speech , teen climate activist Greta Thunberg kicked the day off with a reality check . " The climate and the environment are hot topics right now , " Thunberg said on a morning panel , " but pretty much nothing has been done . " ( It was such a hot ticket , a woman was overheard listening to the panel livestream while using the ladies ' room , our colleague Cristina Gonzales writes in to report . ) <p> **A message from Goldman Sachs : Goldman Sachs believes sustainable finance is where the world is going -- it 's no longer on the sidelines , but increasingly core to a company 's business . That 's why sustainability has become a firmwide mandate with a focus on climate transition and inclusive growth . Learn more about the firm 's sustainable finance efforts. ** <p> Trump will be in town until Wednesday , and has a series of bilateral meetings scheduled , including with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen this afternoon . Also in that meeting : European Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan and Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton . What could they possibly all be talking about ? <h> TECH CENTRAL <p> TAX TRUCE ? A European alliance is trying to get Trump on board with a joint approach for taxing digital giants . If that fails , Europe 's mountain musketeers are seeking to at least settle Trump 's current tax spat with France . Those efforts appear to be off to a good start , with French President Emmanuel Macron tweeting late Monday that he had an " excellent discussion " with Trump on the digital tax , and Trump echoing that sentiment . <p> After that pleasant exchange , reports of a truce : Macron has agreed to postpone France 's tech tax until the end of the year , Elisa Braun reports for POLITICO 's Technology , Financial Services and Trade Pros . The Wall Street Journal reports that Trump pledged to postpone retaliatory tariffs in return . French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire is expected to meet with his U.S. counterpart Steve Mnuchin in Davos on Wednesday . Stay tuned for more . <p> AI 'S NOT AS SCARY AS THE BOMB : Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei tried to sound reassuring on a panel this morning ominously titled " Technology Arms Race , " ( though he asked for trouble by opening with comments about an " explosion " in artificial intelligence ) . It was touted by the Economist 's Zanny Minton Beddoes as " one of the hottest tickets in Davos " -- not to mention one of the most controversial . <p> The Huawei CEO recalled that when he was a child , " the biggest fear people had was atom bombs . But if we look at history from a distance , we see enormous benefits from atomic energy and radiation , for example in medicine . Today we see fears about artificial intelligence , but we should not exaggerate : AI is not as damaging as atom bombs . " That did n't convince fellow panelist Yuval Noah Harari , a historian from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem . " The problem with AI in comparison with atomic weapons is that the danger is not so obvious , " he responded . " Everyone knows you ca n't win a nuclear war , but people do think you can win an AI arms race . That 's dangerous . " <p> POLITICO INTERVIEW : En route to Davos , Microsoft President Brad Smith swung by POLITICO 's office in Brussels . He said his company was prepared to help Europe control where and how its data is processed , amid intensifying debate over whether data should be stored in the bloc . " The default is rapidly becoming that European data should stay in Europe and be subject to European rules . We will adapt to that , " said Smith . " The real question is what 's the model for the use of data that will insure that value of the data accrues to these countries . " <h> WALKING THE WALK ... KINDA <p> GEOGRAPHY DOES N'T LIE : Climate and sustainability may be the talk of the town , but Playbook took a stroll along the Promenade and spotted the SDG tent quite a hike away -- an afterthought ? -- from the center of the action , where companies like Google , Facebook and Philip Morris International have set up shop . Not exactly the best way to convince people that sustainable change is at the heart of the discussions . <p> AND INVITATIONS DO N'T EITHER : Was historian Rutger Bregman not invited back to the WEF this year because he offended the rich and powerful last year ? That 's his take . At the 2019 forum , Bregman called out the hypocrisy of tax-minimizing billionaires flying into Davos aboard their private jets to decry climate change and inequality . <p> TROUVEZ LES FEMMES : We grilled the WEF Monday about the slow progress of increasing women 's participation at Davos . The forum responded by pledging to double female involvement by 2030 . <p> ' DOUBTS WELCOME ' : Philip Morris International is transitioning to " delivering a smoke-free future . " If that makes you raise an eyebrow , you are not the only one . The cigarette titan has a pop-up shop on the promenade where it 's pushing its " unsmoked " concept and inviting doubters to come inside and debate . Overheard at its party last night ( where attendees were serenaded by Sheryl Crow ) : " Nicotine is n't the problem , burning it is . " <p> SLEEPING IN THE SNOW -- DAVOS STYLE : Playbook 's Ryan Heath joined campaigners seeking to end homelessness in the snow last night , bunking down in a sleeping bag with some hay bales as a wind barrier against the -- 17-degree-centigrade weather . Having enjoyed the Davos high life , Ryan wanted to experience the rough end of extreme housing , inequality and weather . His takeaway : wind is the real enemy . <p> There 's a permanent risk of being discovered and told to move , and every footfall , car light or sudden movement is liable to wake you . Leaving the sleeping camp just before 6 a.m. also presented a whole new side of Davos : the supplier class made up of e-car drivers , safety officers , food vendors and others who are all up well before dawn making the WEF work for the 0.1 percent . <p> RAINBOW WAVE : Jin Xing , one of Monday night 's Crystal Award winners , is known as the Chinese Oprah , but most interestingly she gained fame and a devoted following by detailing her journey from male army colonel to female TV personality . That prominence is n't quite matched in the rest of the program , but this year there are three official WEF sessions on LGBTQ themes , including " Free to Be ( LGBTI ) " from 9 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. on Wednesday at the Swiss Alpine High School Auditorium . GLAAD and the Ariadne Getty Foundation are going big on Thursday , including a dinner with Yo-Yo Ma . The goal : LGBTQ advocates want to send the message that WEF 's biggest partners want these issues elevated up Davos ' agenda . <p> DAVOS GOGGLES ? " Davos is the place where conflicts are averted , business is started , disputes are finished " -- so said Ursula von der Leyen in her Monday address . If you are scratching your head to come up with which conflicts were averted in Davos , you are not the only one . <h> REPORTS CORNER <p> SLUGGISH GROWTH : That 's the 2020 forecast by IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva , and one big underlying culprit is none other than trade wars . " Global growth remains sluggish ... adjusting to live with the new normal of higher uncertainty read : Trump ... the underlying causes for trade tension are still with us , " she said . But it 's not just trade : " Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East " and " the dramatic impact that climate shocks can have as seen recently in Australia and parts of Africa " are also factors . <p> Side note : Is n't it interesting how Australia gets a name-check , but African countries are lumped together ? <p> OH THE HYPOCRISY : A report by Greenpeace highlights that 24 banks which regularly attend the WEF have provided $1.4 trillion of financial support for the fossil fuel industry since the Paris agreement set new emissions reduction goals in 2015 . More in this write-up by the Guardian . <p> A PESSIMISTIC GLOBAL ELITE -- PWC GLOBAL CEO SURVEY : CEOs worldwide recorded a record level of pessimism in this year 's PWC survey of some 1,500 chief execs in 83 countries . That 's despite the fact that only two years ago , the 2018 CEO survey recorded a level of optimism never seen before when it comes to worldwide economic growth . <p> TOUGH TIMES FOR DEMOCRACY AND CAPITALISM : According to the Edelman Trust Barometer , 56 percent of respondents to a survey across 28 countries worldwide agreed that " capitalism as it exists today does more harm than good in the world . " At Tuesday morning 's launch event , former Danish PM Helle Thorning Schmidt said " I am worried business will not do enough to support democracy . We need all the help we can get . " Microsoft president Brad Smith added : " Fix democracy first . We 'll find a way to do our business after that . " <h> DAVOS INSIDER <p> LUNCH MATTERS : Word to the wise : If you are not staying in one of the ( very few ) hotels do n't have a reservation , your chances of getting a proper warm meal are nil . Head to the nearest supermarket -- their cantines serve warm food all day . <p> BADGE HIERARCHY : This year , there are two levels of hotel badges ( and a very long line to pick them up , if you have n't already ) : " Strategic Partner Hotel Badges " -- all hotels , all days -- and " Regular , " which are for one day only . <p> GROW-HO-HO : Facebook 's own promotional magazine , Grow , is being stocked next to the Harvard Business Review , Arab News , FT and NY Times in the Belvedere Hotel lobby . Its cover is a " 50 over 50 " list of entrepreneurs ... they really have given up on the kids ! <p> RESPONSIBLE SWAG : Zurich at Promenade 84 has the usual blue beanies , plus coffee , tea and soup . New this year : For every beanie given away , Zurich will plant a tree . As of Monday night , they 'd given away 3,759 of them . <p> OTT : Some chalets are as tall as six storeys and come with teams of drivers , chefs and yoga instructors . A full-time Davos driver will set you back $10,000 for the week , if the amount one large consulting firm has paid up is any indication . Corporations are taking over not only shopfronts ( hence the dearth of lunch options ) but whole apartments above them and converting them into meeting and event spaces . Some , like Facebook , have erected temporary buildings that will disappear the week after Davos . <p> **A message from Goldman Sachs : Over the next 10 years , Goldman Sachs will target $750 billion of financing , investing and advisory activity to nine areas that focus on climate transition and inclusive growth . Because , at Goldman Sachs , they believe sustainable finance is where the world is going -- it is no longer on the sidelines , but increasingly core to a company 's business . As part of this push , Goldman Sachs is committed to helping clients position themselves for a future in which sustainability is core to all industries and integrated across markets -- making sustainable finance a firmwide mandate , to achieve an inclusive , low-carbon economy . Learn more about Goldman Sachs ' newly announced sustainable finance goal. ** <p> Good day and welcome to Day 2 of POLITICO 's Davos Playbook . Today 's the soft launch ; on Tuesday , the serious business starts . Catch up on Sunday 's preview newsletter here . <h> DRIVING THE DAY <p> IN CASE YOU HAVE N'T NOTICED -- DAVOS IS GOING GREEN : It 's wall-to-wall sustainability this year ( private jets aside , cough cough ) . You ca n't escape climate exhortations on stage , on billboards , or even at the buffet line . Wednesday will be a meat-free day at the WEF . <p> SLUMMING IT : More photographic evidence that not everyone at Davos is living it up in the lap of luxury . Playbook is starting to wonder if there is n't some subliminal messaging going on with all these Twitter posts . <p> NOT SLALOMING IT : And even if you 've managed to get some more luxurious digs , there 's no rest up the mountain this year . Mondays at past WEFs might have included a leisurely day skiing or a late arrival for many participants , since not much happened before the official WEF opening on Monday evening . This year , agendas started filling up with a round of Sunday night welcome drinks , while this afternoon you can find side events on everything from cryptocurrencies to cannabis and CEOs . Then the Monday welcome drinks begin . <p> But Davos is not monopolizing summitry today ... <p> BRITISH PM BORIS JOHNSON IS BUSY with the inaugural U.K.-Africa Investment Summit , which will feature more than 20 of Africa 's 54 leaders , who are in London today . While that 's more than the African leadership contingent in Davos , it 's only around half the number of African leaders who turned up to Beijing and Moscow in recent months for similar summits . <p> SOME EUROPEAN POLITICS : European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will have to ponder a tempting offer : Local paper Tages-Anzeiger reports that during a bilateral meeting today , Swiss President Simonetta Sommaruga will offer additional financial help for the EU 's migration and climate change policies -- in exchange for more favorable conditions when it comes to the EU-Switzerland framework agreement , which has been in the works for ages . <p> MACRON IS CHOOSING FRANCE and gathering 200 French and foreign CEOs , for the third year in a row , in Versailles . Sunday evening , Macron announced ? 4 billion in new investments from companies like MSC , Coca-Cola andAstraZeneca . JPMorgan Chase announced plans to double its staff in Paris in coming years as it relocates some of its services from London after Brexit , though the U.K. capital will remain far ahead of Paris in terms of headcount . <p> MEANWHILE , Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai is in Brussels today . He will meet with digital and competition chief Margrethe Vestager and Europe 's Green Deal Vice President Frans Timmermans . <p> Davos twofers : These CEO meets have one thing in common : They 're piggybacking on Davos , with more and more corporate and government leaders gathering in the fourth week of January . They either use Davos as the anchor for a meeting-packed Europe trip , or they use it as the hook to get people to their own events -- a kind of two-for-one deal behind the WEF 's back . <p> ' MAKE THE WORLD COOL AGAIN ' : If you see flowers and koala bears trekking through the snow en route from Landquart to Davos , do n't be alarmed ( unless you 're a climate offender ) : Climate activists dressed in costumes , holding banners that call for people to " ignore the Donalds and listen to the Gretas , " set off Sunday on the three-day , 40-kilometer ( 25 mile ) , frigid hike . <p> And they 've already left some traces along the way : You might see " NO PLANET B " in the snow on your way in today , as RTE 's Will Goodbody did . <h> THINGS TO PONDER <p> HAVE WE PEAKED ? Apparently some think we have reached the turning point on a host of the most important characteristics of the post-World War II Western world : globalization and capitalism . And as a result , we will be seeing more corporate responsibility given to stakeholders , with more concrete work to fight climate change and inequality . If it sounds a little familiar , that 's because we 've heard it before , but Playbook will keep an open mind throughout this week and look for signs of this momentous change . Bloomberg has a rundown of a few other areas in which the world has reportedly peaked . <p> THE NEW POWER-BROKERS : Most people did n't know what a CSO was several years ago ( it 's the chief security officer , for the record ) , but their rapid ascent continues . Ask around and you will soon realize they can have more power at their fingertips than CEOs , including the ability to shut down a company 's website or operations when under attack , without waiting for the CEO 's approval . Stay tuned for more over the coming days . <p> QUOTABLE : " Every company is now a tech company , it does n't matter what they sell , " says Brett Solomon , head of digital rights NGO Access Now . <p> WHY WEF IS LIKE HIGH SCHOOL : Do n't worry about fitting in , because everyone is as insecure as the next person in Davos . The truly important people feel weird because here they are just averagely important . The CEOs feel weird because officially they are below the national leaders in the pecking order , and ca n't escape that fact the way they do the other 51 weeks of the year . Ministers feel weird because no one recognizes them and they 're often separated from their minders . And everyone else feels like the plain person at Fashion Week . It 's perverted egalitarianism but it is , well , equalizing . <p> ... AND WHY EVERYONE COMES ANYWAY* : David Gelles for the New York Times writes that the forum has " become a punchline " but quotes Eurasia Group 's Ian Bremmer , saying " Six days of work at Davos is easily six months of work in other places " because of the intensity of private meetings among powerful people . <p> *Bill Gates is a notable absentee this year . " Bill 's schedule has shifted and he 's unable to attend Davos as planned , " his foundation said via email . <p> WHERE THERE 'S NO SMOKE , THERE 'S FIRE : Philip Morris , straining to pitch itself as more than a tobacco company ( an especially sensitive element in Davos , in light of the WEF 's ban on tobacco sponsorship ) , will be hosting a " Grand Opening " to rival the WEF 's official one , featuring a live performance by nine-time Grammy winner Sheryl Crow tonight at 6 p.m. at Promenade 63 . British artist Beverley Knight will close out the week with a live performance Thursday evening . <p> AUTO-SCHWAB -- AIRING TODAY : Filmmaker Marcus Vetter followed WEF founder Klaus Schwab for a whole year , and got very much behind the scenes . ARD airs the long-form documentary tonight ; here 's a link , and here 's where to find other language versions . <p> SUCCESSION ? Schwab sat down with CNBC for a rather odd , softball interview about his succession plans for WEF . Spoiler alert : He 's not planning on stepping down any time soon , he jokes about coming to the office with " more ideas than they can digest , " and he 's open to his son playing a large role after he 's gone ( Olivier Schwab is WEF 's head of business engagement . ) <p> -- Women and girls put in 12.5 billion hours of unpaid care work each and every day -- a contribution to the global economy of at least $10.8 trillion a year , which is more than three times the size of the global tech industry . <p> -- Getting the richest 1 percent to pay just 0.5 percent extra tax on their wealth over the next 10 years would equal the investment needed to create 117 million jobs in sectors such as elderly and childcare , education and health . <p> WEF 'S INAUGURAL SOCIAL MOBILITY REPORT : Top findings are that increasing social mobility , a key driver of income equality , by 10 percent would boost economic growth by nearly 5 percent over the next decade . The Top 10 countries in the Global Social Mobility Index are all European , the Top 5 all Scandinavian , while the five economies with the most to gain from boosting social mobility are China , the United States , India , Japan and Germany . Report here . <h> SWAG ALERT <p> -- Davos ' bottom feeders -- those with " hotel badges " -- have been excited to find a free one-day ski pass in their welcome kit . <p> -- Coffee wars : It 's not just Palantir and its sleek pavilion trying to swap coffee for your data this year . Facing off against the data giant are the Saudis , who are trying to woo your love and tourism interest in exchange for caffeine . Tata Consultancy is offering both coffee and tea in a literal face-off with the Saudis mid-Promenade . <p> Keep your eyes open and send your swag tips to davos@politico.eu . Last year 's best included free cashmere scarves from an American online university called WorldQuant . <h> TRUMP WATCH <p> MILESTONE : Today marks three years of Donald Trump 's U.S. presidency . His impeachment trial starts on Tuesday , along with his return ( diversion ? ) to Davos . For more on that , tune in to tomorrow 's edition . <h> APR ? S <p> I DAVOS , THEREFORE I WILL.I.AM : It seems rappers never die , they just go to Davos . The town 's perpetual celebrity will be speaking on inspiring young people and his AI company I.AM+ . <p> SKI REPORT : Today 's the coldest day of the week , so break out all your warmest gear : the high today will be -- 4C ( it 's a bitter -- 9 as Playbook hits your inboxes ) . There was a light snow dusting Sunday evening , but ski conditions are good . <p> TUNES : If any of this year 's attendees need a little encouragement on their transformational paths , David Bowie 's got some words for you . Go on , get those Changes in place . <p> SECURITY ! If you took the train up to Davos on Sunday , you probably saw groups of Swiss military coming in too . Do n't be alarmed , one young soldier told Playbook , they were just folks returning from their weekends away and deployments to secure the forum for the coming week . <p> TECH SNAFU : WEF participants were lining up round the corner for their badges at 11 p.m . Sunday night after first the registration center security scanners broke down , and then the computer network was blocked . <p> **A message from Goldman Sachs : At Goldman Sachs , sustainability is a firmwide mandate with a focus on the interconnected themes of climate transition and inclusive growth . The firm is committed to helping its clients position themselves for a future in which sustainability is core to all industries and integrated across markets . They will achieve this vision by doing what they do best -- invest , finance , advise , and innovate -- to drive global climate transition and inclusive growth strategies that accelerate positive change . That 's why Goldman Sachs is targeting $750 billion in sustainable finance growth themes by 2030 . Explore the firm 's newly announced sustainable finance goal. ** <p> Good day and welcome to the 50th edition of the World Economic Forum -- and another year of POLITICO 's Davos Playbook , the essential daily guide to life on the world 's most elite mountain . <p> Here is the WEF center stage program , with notes on which sessions are livestreamed ( 224 will be online ) . <p> This month is also the centenary of the Treaty of Versailles going into effect , and entirely timely , as Great Power competition seems to be making a big comeback . Will this year 's forum help foster a regrouping of liberal democracies away from trade wars and toward more diplomatic cooperation on issues like Iran , proliferation , etc ? ( U.S. President Donald Trump and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are expected to meet here to talk tariffs . ) And will the fires in Australia finally light a fire under the bums of the powers that be to take meaningful climate action ? <p> **A message from Goldman Sachs : Goldman Sachs believes sustainable finance is where the world is going -- it 's no longer on the sidelines , but increasingly core to a company 's business . That 's why sustainability has become a firmwide mandate with a focus on climate transition and inclusive growth . Learn more about the firm 's sustainable finance efforts. ** <h> TOP TOPIC -- CLIMATE CHANGE <p> GET ON THE GREEN TEAM OR GO HOME : Or that 's the stated goal at least . WEF is going all-in against climate change this year . With Australia reeling from catastrophic bushfires that have ravaged a huge chunk of its biodiversity , the theme could not be more relevant . Barely an hour will pass without a climate or broader sustainability session in the official program , never mind the extensive unofficial events and billboards that overtake the town . <p> WEF is also on its way to becoming climate activist Greta Thunberg 's amplifier-in-chief . The forum presents her ahead of Donald Trump and Angela Merkel in its list of high-profile speakers and reposts her articles , for example , including this Davos preview article in the Guardian , where Thunberg says : " Anything less than immediately ceasing these investments in the fossil fuel industry would be a betrayal of life itself . " <p> WEF 's alignment with Thunberg reflects many things , including the increasing concerns of WEF employees when it comes to the climate plans of companies and governments that WEF brings together year-round . " Heightened impatience " is how one polite Davos veteran staffer described the atmosphere to Playbook . Will peer pressure from all the discussions help CEOs and leaders put their money where their mouths are ? Stay tuned . <p> CONTEXT OUTSIDE THE SNOW GLOBE : Geopolitical crises are never too far in the background , though . There 's a highly anticipated conference on Libya underway in Berlin as this Playbook hits your inboxes . Protests over corruption and demanding more self-determination are still raging in Lebanon , Iraq and Iran . And the Iran nuclear deal standoff , with the triggering of the dispute resolution mechanism , casts an ever-longer shadow over any discussions about peace and security , even though Iran 's Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif pulled out of the forum this year . <p> Expect a more heated tone in some forum sessions this year : Some CEOs as well as WEF staffers are losing their patience . Ibrahim AlHusseini , an early Tesla and Uber investor who now heads investment firm FullCycle , told Playbook 's Ryan Heath that businesses need to be guided by " ecosystem supremacy . " His view is that while it 's progress for the U.S. Business Roundtable to join WEF in advocating stakeholder interests alongside shareholder interests , it 's not enough . <p> " Even financial winners have to breathe the air . They 'll have to drink water , " he said . " They still live in this closed sphere but there is nowhere else to go . So everything has to be factored in from now on . We have the science , we have the data . We have the proof . Technologies are ready . There is more than enough money sloshing around to fix this . There is no excuse to keep kicking the can forward . " <p> Look out for more " climate heroes " ( WEF 's words ) this week who are n't Greta . The teen category includes : Fionn Ferreira , who 's working to extract microplastics from water ; Melati Wijsen , who led a ban on plastic bags , straws and styrofoam in Bali ; and Autumn Peltier , the Anishinabek Nation 's 15-year-old chief water commissioner , in Canada . Adults include : Neel Tamhane , who leads a citizen tree-planting drive that 's put 9 billion trees in the ground in 27 cities in South Asia , and Jane Goodall , the primatologist who redefined the relationship between humans and animals <p> Half of economy dependent on nature : A new WEF analysis examining 163 industry sectors and their supply chains suggests " $44 trillion of economic value generation -- over half the world 's total GDP -- is moderately or highly dependent on nature and its services and , as a result , exposed to risks from nature loss . Construction ( $4 trillion ) , agriculture ( $2.5 trillion ) and food and beverages ( $1.4 trillion ) are the three largest industries that depend most on nature . " <h> GUEST GUIDE <p> DAVOS A VICTIM OF ITS OWN SUCCESS ? With every global conference now looking and feeling like Davos ( think Halifax Security Forum , Munich Security Forum , German Marshall Fund conferences , NATO Engages , Doha Forum ) : What is Davos anymore ? Decision-makers and experts seem to travel around a conference circuit tearing their hair out over populism on big white sofas arranged in semi-circles against blue backdrops . Then there are competitors who borrow liberally from the WEF format , such as Concordia Summit . And to top it off : there 's more programming outside the Congress Center than inside it , putting pressure on the WEF business model . The WEF 's success is making it a victim of global elite hyperinflation . <p> Cherchez les femmes : Gender parity has n't reached the Davos summit yet . There are 2,800 participants from more than 118 countries , according to the WEF , and yet only 24 percent are women . Some might say that 's progress ( the WEF has been stuck at around 20 percent female participation for many years ) , but still not enough . WEF points out that this is more than the 21 percent share of ministerial posts women hold worldwide , and well above the ratio of female CEOs globally . <p> The radical new choice : Just stay home . More often than not , WEF press releases herald a record number of leaders and CEOs and ministers heading to Davos . This year the numbers are impressive -- but flat : around 280 senior public leaders , including more than 50 national leaders . For corporate denizens of Davos , quite a few among Playbook 's contacts are skipping this year 's event with a shrug . <p> A more radical choice ? A co-creator of Occupy Wall Street attending . " Rejecting Davos is easy when one has not been invited to attend , " Micah White writes . So he 's coming and committing " reputational suicide " -- it 's all very dramatic , but in a constructive way . " What I discovered is that Davos is not one thing . There are many Davoses at Davos . And it is possible to reject one or more sides of the gathering while still finding revolutionary potential in another aspect of it , " White said . We 'll have to check in with him at the end to see how many of his goals he managed to achieve . <p> WHO 'S NOT : French President Emmanuel Macron , ever the disrupter , is still staying away -- but not without having his own mini French Davos , called Choose France ( cheekily taking advantage of CEOs coming to Davos to make a stop in Paris first and discover all the ways Macron says his reforms have improved the investment environment . At least that 's the Elys ? e 's pitch ) . Macron also heads on Tuesday to Israel and the Palestinian territories . He 'll be attending the 75th commemoration of the liberation of Auschwitz . <p> This year Boris Johnson has gone as far as to ban his ministers from attending -- except for Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid . The U.S. Congress delegation will be relatively small , thanks to the Democratic primary and impeachment process . <p> EU chief diplomat Josep Borrell was vocal about his non-attendance : " In Europe , everybody is rushing to Davos , but I think it is more important to be here , " Borrell said at the Raisina Dialogue on global governance in New Delhi . ( A good handful of his fellow EU commissioners are actually going to Davos . ) <p> It 's a kind of " Back to the Future " exercise , given that Klaus Schwab -- the Founder and Executive Chairman of the WEF -- has always advocated long-term sustainable capitalism ( see his original 1973 Davos Manifesto ) . And yet , it 's inescapable that in providing a platform for engagement with all manner of CEOs and controversial regimes , Davos is n't just a place of consensus and dialogue -- it 's also a platform used by those leaders for reputational airbrushing . That leads Playbook to ask : Is Davos one of the reasons we need a new type of capitalism ? <p> ' CEO disease ' : Perhaps another incentive for a new type of capitalism might be selfish ? The coterie of the world 's most powerful and wealthiest will be told this week , by Dr. Marta Ra of Paracelsus Recovery , a leading psychiatric treatment center in London , that the very traits that make exceptional senior executives -- tenacity , resilience , risk-taking -- are also linked to addiction , depression and anxiety . The clinic has identified a 500 percent increase in referrals of CEOs in the last seven years , with bipolar disorder becoming increasingly prevalent , according to the Telegraph . And the WEF is devoting several sessions this year to mental health . After all , the clinics in Davos that a century ago treated tuberculosis , as made famous in a certain Thomas Mann novel , are now treating burnout and depression . <h> DAVOS ESSENTIALS <p> CHECK YOUR RESERVATION ... if you 're booked at Hotel B ? nda : The establishment changed management in November . But the previous one had already sold rooms for WEF week , Blick newspaper reported . And many of those affected will first find out when trying to check in : " When we first came to the hotel , the servers were empty , " the new manager told the paper . " We could not find out who had already booked and paid for rooms . That 's why we could n't get in touch with the people concerned . " Seems you 're safe and will get a room if you 've made a reservation via the WEF 's own service provider . <p> Street sleeping in Davos : If Hotel B ? nda guests find themselves homeless , they wo n't be the only ones sleeping on the streets . Despite the below-freezing temperatures ( more like -15 Celsius or 0 degrees Fahrenheit ) , Homeless Entrepreneur , an NGO that campaigns to help the homeless use and gain skills to build new lives , will have its activists sleeping out on the streets starting Monday . The contrast between the private jets of the WEF set and those in their sleeping bags will be stark . Playbook 's Ryan Heath will be joining them , more in Tuesday 's Playbook . <p> Somewhere in between : Not everyone stays in hotels when attending Davos , or on the street . In fact , many stay in apartments in town or a trek away . And it 's not exactly fancy-ville . Behold WEF Managing Director Adrian Monck 's " glamorous " digs . <p> PRO TIP -- DRESS CODE : You 're spending a week on a mountain . Besides the obvious need for sensible snow shoes , make sure you wear layers and make at least one other concession to your setting . Maybe it 's a sweater , a jacket with a faux-fur-lined hood , or some statement boots . Whatever you do , do n't storm around the mountain in a suit alone . It does n't impress anyone : it makes you look like a tone-deaf first-timer . <p> SKI REPORT : It 's expected to be sunny and chilly Monday . Higher up , on the ski slopes , expect a frigid -15 Celsius . It snowed all morning Sunday , with low visibility at times . The pavements are slushy rather than icy across Davos town . <p> STUCK IN KLOSTERS ? If you 're not staying in Davos itself , you 're either VVIP and paying for privacy , or you booked late or are on a budget . Never fear : try the Chesa Grischuna , an old haunt of Hollywood stars and royals . If a 25-minute train ride schedule is n't convenient , the WEF shuttle leaves from Piz Buin and opposite the train station from 6 a.m. each morning , and runs until midnight ( 2.5 hours longer than the trains run ) . <h> ACTIVITY GUIDE <p> HOTTEST TICKETS : We 'll keep you up to date each morning , but we 're willing to bet Priyanka Chopra Jonas will have an edge in grabbing attention when she urges leaders to end extreme poverty . If you want to join her Tuesday , you can sign up for the " Reimagining the World 's Biggest Challenges " lunch ( hosted by Global Citizen and Teneo ) here . <p> THE PARTY WARS : Cloudflare saw the gap left by Google giving up on their annual Davos party and zoomed right into it last year . They were determined to win the crown of best Davos closing party from Salesforce ( many say they succeeded ) , and this year they 've co-opted Hotel Europe 's karaoke piano bar legend Barry , and set him up as the social sub-brand of Cloudflare Haus , at Promenade 37 . On Thursday night , Jason Derulo will top the Cloudflare party bill . <p> Freuds ' Davos House will once again be the nightcap venue of choice each night . The PR agency runs Sustainable Development Goals-themed programming until the bubbles and cocktails flow . The question on everyone 's lips : After bringing over five-star sushi chefs from London in 2019 , what will they do to whet appetites this year ? <p> If you ca n't make it across the river to Davos House , try Davos Cannabis House -- for market research only , of course . This important emerging market can be found at Promenade 69 . <p> TUNES : Davos veterans know there 's never a shortage of records spinning . So this year we 'll have Playbook Songs for the Day . Send us the song that 'll be playing between your ears this week . In the spirit of this year 's theme , let 's kick it off with two songs , one for the stakeholders , all of them , including the Salt of The Earth , and one for the climate -- because what is a Green Davos without snow ? Special thanks to Bruno Tertrais , deputy director of the Fondation pour la Recherche Strat ? gique , for the suggestions . <p> **A message from Goldman Sachs : Over the next 10 years , Goldman Sachs will target $750 billion of financing , investing and advisory activity to nine areas that focus on climate transition and inclusive growth . Because , at Goldman Sachs , they believe sustainable finance is where the world is going -- it is no longer on the sidelines , but increasingly core to a company 's business .

Safe travels back home everybody , and see you all up on the mountain again next year . If you liked what you read and heard here this week , subscribe to Florian 's Brussels Playbook and tune in to Ryan 's EU Confidential podcast for more . <p> " Foreboding about the future was a prevailing theme at this year 's Davos , sometimes even with a dash of dystopian prophecy , " according to John . " This brooding was accompanied often , in speeches and interviews , by a rueful acknowledgment that government leaders are desperately improvising -- often with bleak results -- to meet the political crises of the moment , much less the long-term technological and climatological challenges of the age . " <p> The big challenges ? " In key Western capitals , governance is failing . China is exploiting . Global temperatures are rising . Tech titans are groveling . Prospects for economic downturn are rumbling . Little wonder that , instead of triumphant optimism about the forces of globalization sometimes associated with Davos , some voices here made it sound like modern life is on a toboggan ride to hell . " Read on here . <p> **A message from Philip Morris International : We are delivering a smoke-free future , but we ca n't do it alone . We ask the world 's leaders to join us in a conversation : 1.1 billion cigarette smokers deserve better options . Support the vision for a smoke-free future . Learn more here. ** <p> THURSDAY 'S PARTY WARS REPORT : Cloudflare lit up the Strip -- um , Promenade -- with Ellie Goulding , in acoustic , a bold challenge to other companies either afraid to host lavish parties in Davos these days or stuck hiring stars from past eras ( a dig at Salesforce who brought Sting to Davos , but forgot to invite Playbook , though we crossed Sting 's path at Davos House in the wee hours ) . Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince made a point of saying the company wants to highlight a new generation of leaders . Case in point : They brought two survivors of the Parkland school shooting on stage . <p> Meanwhile , Jack Ma and Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang hosted an art gallery dinner Wednesday with performers from all over China ( including Jack who did a magic show ) and Ma 's chefs from Hangzhou . Among the guests : Jordan 's Queen Rania and her son Crown Prince Hussein ; Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz ; the king and queen of Belgium ; Paul Kagame of Rwanda ; Xavier Bettel of Luxembourg ; IMF chief Christine Lagarde ; and CEOs James Quincey of Coca Cola , Carlos Brito of AB InBev , Steve Schwarzman of Blackstone and David Taylor of P&amp;G . <p> THE FACTS ABOUT FACEBOOK : Mark Zuckerberg penned a defense of his company , published in the Wall Street Journal , in which he insists users are in control of how their data is used . <h> MOUNTAIN ORACLE <p> GEORGE SOROS ATTACKS CHINA : Artificial Intelligence can do a great deal of harm to societies when in the wrong hands , the Hungarian-American philanthropist slash investor said over dinner Thursday . And by wrong , he meant Chinese . " China is not the only authoritarian regime in the world but it is the wealthiest , strongest and technologically most advanced , " said Soros . " This makes Xi Jinping the most dangerous opponent of open societies . " <p> Soros , as always , had strong opinions and harsh words for the enemies of open societies , his erstwhile opponents . And , as every so often , he was the one on Thursday to encapsulate the general consensus on the biggest issue at Davos week . And yet , there was no word on Hungary , or its prime minister , Viktor Orb ? n -- perhaps , at 88 , he 's come to think there are bigger fish to fry . <p> Call to action : " Instead of letting ZTE and Huawei off lightly , the U.S. needs to crack down on them . If these companies came to dominate the 5G market , they would present an unacceptable security risk for the rest of the world . " <h> DAVOS PLAYBOOK INTERVIEW <p> HUGE THREAT , CREDIBLE ANSWERS : NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the Alliance will come up with " credible deterrence and defense " should Russia continue to breach the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces ( INF ) Treaty , the agreement that since 1988 has banned all land-based missiles with a range of 500 to 5,500 kilometers . " We have asked all our military authorities , our commanders to look into different options and consequences , " Stoltenberg told Playbook in an interview in Davos Thursday , adding that NATO " will make a measured , proportionate and defensive decision . " <p> IT 'S SERIOUS ... " The INF treaty has been for 30 years the cornerstone of arms control . The treaty not only reduced the number of missiles but actually banned a whole category , " Stoltenberg said , referring to intermediate-range weapons . <p> Russia , he went on , " has developed and is deploying new missiles " that are " mobile , hard to detect , nuclear capable " and can reach European cities " with little warning time . " That also means the threshold for any use of nuclear weapons in a conflict is " reduced , " he said . <p> ... AND DANGEROUS FOR EUROPE : The collapse of the INF treaty most immediately creates grave new risks for Europe , especially because Russia already has its new missiles in place and any response by the West would likely hinge on the U.S. deploying new weapons on the Continent . Given transatlantic tensions , it 's far from clear that protecting Europe is high on U.S. President Donald Trump 's list of priorities . <p> DIPLOMACY FIRST : NATO ambassadors will meet with Russia today in a special NATO-Russia council , the main purpose of which , according to Stoltenberg , " is to discuss the INF treaty and for NATO allies to be able to call on Russia to come back into compliance of the treaty in a verifiable and transparent way . " Stoltenberg said Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov will attend . <p> Reminder : Russia insists its new missile is not in breach of the obligations stemming from the treaty . The U.S. , dismissing those claims , has threatened to pull out of the treaty starting February 2 if Russia does not back down . <p> The bottom line : NATO has to prepare for " a world without the INF treaty , " according to Stoltenberg . Playbook 's translation : At the moment , there 's still no Plan B. <h> BREXIT ENTERTAINMENT <p> AKK ON FIRST FOREIGN MISSION : Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer , the new leader of Germany 's Christian Democratic Union , may have been in Chancellor Angela Merkel 's shadow on her trip to Davos -- and was not to be found on the official program -- but , well , Merkel did leave her a few issues to tackle , including Brexit . <p> " It is not clear what the U.K. wants , " Kramp-Karrenbauer told Bloomberg . " Once we have Brexit , there will be a European border between Ireland and Northern Ireland and we will need to have an agreement which has some kind of backstop . " <p> VARADKAR 'S ALLEGIANCES : " Ireland has obligations to protect the single market , " Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said during a Davos panel debate . " The United Kingdom would have a responsibility to abide by World Trade Organization rules , and both the United Kingdom and Ireland would have responsibilities to honor the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process . " <p> What would happen in case of no deal ? " So I think we 'd end up in a situation whereby the EU and Ireland and the U.K. would have to come together and in order to honor our commitment to the people of Ireland that there would be no hard border , we would have to agree on full alignment on customs and regulations . " <p> Is there a Brit in the room ? The audience would have loved to hear U.K. Chancellor Philip Hammond 's view -- alas , he pulled out of the panel discussion at the last minute . <p> ' No deal wo n't work ' : In the coatroom line outside the British business lunch at Davos ' Belvedere Hotel , Ryan overheard a senior British finance executive say to another U.K. executive : " I just saw Liam Fox and I lost the plot completely . I said you 've got to get out of your fact-free fantasy world . You know no deal wo n't work . We all know no deal wo n't work . " <h> QUEER DAVOS PEEKS THROUGH <p> Given the number of participating governments that , let 's face it , have little interest in promoting LGBT rights , it 's perhaps not surprising that LGBT issues have never really become part of the mainstream conversation here . <p> That 's shifted a little in recent years , thanks to organizations like Open for Business , GLAAD , HubCulture Pavilion , and the Ariadne Getty Foundation , which host unofficial events in hotels around town . But " there 's a lot more work to be done here , " said GLAAD director Sarah Kate Ellis . <p> In the spotlight : Tim Cook , the world 's most prominent openly gay CEO , joined the Davos event this year . And not without controversy . While Apple is usually invisible here , Cook chose to surface for dinner with Jair Bolsonaro , Brazil 's homophobic far-right president . <p> Where to next ? At this year 's LGBTQ lunch panel , the focus was " global acceptance . " " It 's about how we treat each other , " said Jim Fetterling , CEO of Dow . " It 's about staying the room " not simply protesting problem laws , leaders and company policies , he said . <p> Did you know ? Deutsche Bank has a self-described " head gay . " <h> THE GOOD LIFE <p> REVELATION OF 2019 : Brown is the new white . Some of the cooler ( or more unusual -- shout out to you , hat girl ) people , events and parties take place beyond the official WEF space and its supposedly status-conferring white badges . To live the Davos experience these days , all you need is brown-colored plastic -- the so-called hotel badge -- and the kind of entrepreneurialism and energy sometimes harder to find behind the security check . <p> PLAY DATE : When was the last time you played ? At the Real Play Coalition luncheon Thursday , guests played games with the CEOs of IKEA and Lego Foundation , both founding members of the Coalition , alongside Unilever and National Geographic . UNICEF also announced it will be joining the coalition as a co-chair . The group , which included private sector leaders , NGOs , philanthropists and heads of international organizations , discussed the so-called " play gap " and the significance of the erosion of playtime for children around the world . <p> FRIDAY TRADITION REVIVED : The WEF 's Farewell Party at Schatzalp , canceled for years , is now back on the agenda in the form of a mountain lunch today at 1 p.m . <p> FAVORITE QUIP : WEF 's most fashionable attendee -- British fashion designer Ozwald Boateng -- was overhead at Davos House saying he was going to " have a quick Snoop Dogg around . " <p> DAVOS ON THE DNIPRO : Kiev 's rambunctious political scene moved to the Alps . Barely two months before the Ukrainian presidential election , three of the leading candidates -- President Petro Poroshenko ; the unpopular incumbent , opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko ; and Anatoly Hrytsenko , a former defense minister -- traded potshots in separate appearances across Davos Thursday . Poroshenko compared Tymoshenko to the current Venezuelan populist strongman , and she returned the insult . Speaking to Playbook , Hrytsenko said the incumbent needed to hold on to power to stay out of jail , accusing him of corruption . The trio were here , officially , to engage with the world 's politics and business elites and build support for Ukraine , which is entering a sixth year of a hot conflict with Russia . <p> SARDINE CITY : Dutch taxpayers should be proud : The Dutch government is squeezing in up to eight staffers to a room at their hotel in the town of Klosters , itself a cheaper alternative close to Davos . <p> POLITICO PODCAST : In our final daily Davos Confidential , Ryan talks to Dutch Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra about Brexit , what worries him about the EU and why people should vote in May 's European Parliament election . Ryan also speaks to GLAAD chief Sarah Kate Ellis . Listen in here . <p> THE NEXT BIG THING : The value of electronic waste produced each year is $62 billion -- three times the value of all silver produced each year . Check out the WEF report here . Will e-waste the next big thing ? After all , Davos was key to creating momentum for the ban of single-use plastics , by now one of the EU 's cornerstone policies . Stick with us and we 'll get back to you on that . See you next year ! <p> **A message from Philip Morris International : Philip Morris International is delivering a smoke-free future .

If , on the other hand , you think Facebook has made a few mistakes that can be fixed with reforms here and there , Sandberg laid out a decent case Wednesday of how the company is changing ( without explaining how internal culture change is being implemented ) , and that Facebook does more good than bad . That Sandberg felt the need to address the idea of a government banning the tech giant 's business model and business practices , illustrates how rattled Facebook is by recent scandals . That said , Facebook and Sandberg show no sign of going anywhere . <p> SANDBERG 'S LIVE DIE ZEIT INTERVIEW : Sandberg was introduced as a role model and fighter and got a hug from her interviewer , Die Zeit 's Uwe Heuser , when the session ended . The Facebook COO moved quickly into gentle confession mode , saying the tech giant had n't " anticipated all the risks " of its monumental growth , nor " done a good job of explaining " how it handles user data . A recurring theme in Sandberg 's remarks was that the good outweighs the bad at the company , and that the current leadership is best placed to correct its own mistakes . In a move designed to re-orient Facebook to a more regulation-friendly stance , Sandberg said " we 're in a fundamental phase of rewriting the rules about tech . " <p> When Heuser asked why Instagram and WhatsApp chiefs had left the broader Facebook empire , all Sandberg could manage in reply was that she 's proud of how well the company is " sticking together " after a year of scandal . Can Mark Zuckerberg stay on as CEO/chairman supremo ? " I think he should , " she said . <p> Asked why so much data tracking is necessary , Sandberg said Facebook will roll out a " clear history " function on the site to help users minimize it . She rejected the idea of a subscription model though , because it would mean " most people ca n't afford to use it . " <p> **A message from Philip Morris International : We are delivering a smoke-free future , but we ca n't do it alone . We ask the world 's leaders to join us in a conversation : 1.1 billion cigarette smokers deserve better options . Support the vision for a smoke-free future . Learn more here. ** <p> RATING SANDBERG 'S SPEECH : out of five pandas . Sandberg took pointed questions on the chin , issued some soft mea culpas the audience wanted to hear , but successfully defended the core Facebook vision . After her remarks , and after initially leaving the stage , Sandberg bounced back up to literally lean in and strike up a conversation with a female audience member who was wearing a daring blue fur hat . The cameras went wild . It was a deft but slightly too perfect political moment . <p> SANDBERG PART II -- INSIDE HER OFF-RECORD RECEPTION FOR MEDIA : Playbook was invited but unable to attend the off-the-record session . Perhaps the most noteworthy observation from those who did attend : It mirrored the comments Sandberg had given on the record just 90 minutes earlier . <h> TODAY 'S HOT TICKETS <p> IT 'S GEORGE SOROS DAY . The billionaire slammed Facebook at his 2018 annual dinner . Who 'll be the punching bag this year ? Rumor has it he may go after China . <p> HIGH POLITICS : Anthony Scaramucci and Ehud Barak will be in conversation at 3.30 p.m. up the mountain at Canada Cannabis House . ( Israel is a huge medical cannabis center . ) <p> ALSO REST OF THE WORLD DAY : It says something about the lack of newsworthiness of many Davos speeches that we 're as excited about Soros and cannabis as the combined list of Asia , Middle East and African leaders speaking today . Still , here are the other highlights ... <p> At 5:30 p.m . President of South Africa Cyril M. Ramaphosa and President of Rwanda Paul Kagame will discuss African leadership . <p> Today the pro-LGBT forces of Davos ( generally sparse and low-key ) are gathering for lunch with GLAAD . The most interesting prominent gay Davos-goer is Apple CEO Tim Cook . The company is usually invisible here at WEF , so it 's interesting that Cook has chosen to surface this year , including for these dinner photos with Jair Bolsonaro , Brazil 's homophobic far-right president . <p> TONIGHT IS BANKERS ' NIGHT : JP Morgan ( Kirchner Museum ) and Citi ( Belvedere ) hold their receptions with their CEOs tonight , in the dinner window . Bank of America hosts its CEO nightcap at the Belvedere from 10:30 p.m . Ellie Goulding may steal the show , however , at the Cloudflare nightcap . <h> HIGHLIGHTS TOUR <p> MIRACLE ON THE MOUNTAIN : At a dinner hosted by AARP , the first six speakers were women . <p> SPOTLIGHT ON AGEING : At the AARP dinner , which looked at how to achieve more age diversity within organizations and across the workforce , someone noted there were 17 gender sessions at the WEF , but only two on age . Guests at the dinner urged a reframing of workers as " experienced " rather than old . The clear call to action : Interested organizations should work on writing the business case for hiring experienced/older workers . <p> RAJ SHAH OF THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION : The Rockefeller Foundation and Mastercard announced a $50-million investment to accelerate the use of data science by non-profit , civic and government organizations -- the kind of " collaborative philanthropy platforms " the foundation considers its hallmark . Full details here . In a similar vein Co-Impact , a global collaborative of Rockefeller , the Gates Foundation , Skoll , Chandler and the Nilekani family that is focused on improving health , education and economic opportunity , announced $80 million in grants aimed at improving the lives of 9 million people in Africa , South Asia and Latin America . <p> " We really believe in science-based , partner-based efforts that can lift up the lives of millions . Science is how we solve problems , partners is how we get scale , " foundation chief Raj Shah told POLITICO . " That marriage of capabilities is why we get so excited about partnerships . " And that 's more needed now than ever : " Populist energy has caused people to pull back their commitments to help each other out , " -- but private philanthropy is " not a substitute for real American , global , and public leadership , " Shah said . <p> PERSPECTIVE FROM A DAVOS VETERAN : Anna Tunkel , APCO Worldwide 's head of strategic initiatives , started coming to Davos 12 years ago -- before the age of Promenade pop-ups and when daily events outside the Congress Center could be counted on two hands . She told Playbook that this year there are over 100 corporate lounges and pop-ups , and they 're looking quite representative of the changing global order . In other words , the conversation is spilling outside of the Congress Center , it 's much bigger than the WEF can control ( to its dismay ) , and the brands doing the best in their positioning tend to come from China , emerging markets and tech . This year there 's " a Chinese perspective almost on every panel : from future to consumption to trade , techno nationalism and future of global leadership , " Tunkel said . <h> SPEECHES RATED <p> ANGELA MERKEL : . The German chancellor gave the standard multilateral pep talk and said populism leads to misery . Not much charisma or surprise , but that 's very on-brand for Merkel . She went on to join a WEF-organized dinner . <p> SHINZO ABE : and a half pandas . It was all optimism and success and structural reform in the Japanese PM 's speech , despite the country 's ageing and shrinking population . What a reliable multilaterialist . The WEF almost peed its pants in excitement , proclaiming : " PM Shinzo Abe Heralds New Era for Japan as Policies Bear Fruit . " Abe ticked the gender box with " womenomics , " said he was narrowing economic gaps ( equality-ish ! ) , and now we 've got another damn catchphrase to throw in the bin in disgust : " Society 5.0 " -- one premised on borderless data . <p> CONTE , EXPLAINING HIMSELF : Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte , in his address , defended his government 's plans from presumed criticism by saying that everyone else has got it wrong . " For too many years , Italian and European politicians have got the sequencing wrong ... in the past they have asked people to make sacrifices in the name of a more sparkling future ... fearing state failure , they have asked people to tolerate market failures . Citizens are now aware that sacrifices have resulted in a much worse society , " Conte said . Italians believed the EU was the solution to their problems , Conte said , but " reality turned out to be very different instead . " And so , " everyone with a few exceptions senses that tomorrow will be worse than today . " <p> Here 's the kicker : " My government is the institutional answer to the wish of the Italian people of finding a way forward , " Conte said . <p> EUROPE 'S GOT TALENT : Davos Playbook 's Florian Eder had lunch with a very interesting high-level bunch of people ( under Chatham House rules ) Wednesday . They 're thinking hard about how to make Europe more than a self-appraised champion in privacy and data protection -- but at the same time , to make sure the next big thing in tech is European . ( Here 's an accompanying WEF report on the matter . ) The mood at lunch was upbeat , the consensus : Europe is a great place to live and work . <p> It 's a European affair : " We just need to get a few things right , " Portuguese Economy Minister Pedro Siza Vieira told Playbook , citing " collaboration across countries , making sure that funding is appropriate to process that -- and in that way we 'll do another favor to Europe , making sure that every citizen around Europe has an opportunity to thrive in the new economy . " <p> Make the beauties of Europe known : " If I had to make my decision today , I would n't move to the U.S. , " said one participant , calling for the EU to make it known to masters and PhD students from India that they 're welcome on the Continent ( and to change immigration laws accordingly ) . <p> Small can be beautiful : " Europe is n't made for scale , " said another lunch-mate . But that does n't have to be a disadvantage , should the next tech wave not produce consumer-based platforms but solutions for businesses . French-American entrepreneur Hicham Sabir , who was at the lunch , said afterwards : " I think Europe 's strength is in the small and medium enterprises , it 's in the innovation position it already has . " What 's missing ? " A framework to help those companies . " <h> THE GOOD LIFE <p> PUTTING HEART INTO DAVOS : Kiwi PM Jacinda Ardern 's top message : " Be kind " to people . Elisha London , CEO of United for Global Mental Health , gave her a " Be Kind " Badge from Cynthia Germanotta , Lady Gaga 's mother and co-founder of the Born This Way Foundation . <p> MCKINSEY NEWS DESERT : Journalists were not welcome at the McKinsey party Wednesday . <p> SPOTTED : Belgium 's Queen Matilde walking the Promenade after lunch Wednesday . The Netherlands ' Queen M ? xima at Davos House , along with the Crown Prince Haakon of Norway . " House of Cards " actress Robin Wright and Bono deep in conversation in Davos House . Likewise , Britain 's former Foreign Secretary David Miliband with Former Chancellor George Osborne . Matt Damon at a Co-impact collaborative fund breakfast on United Nations sustainable development goals . <p> NO THANKS ! For Swisscom 's terrible mobile Wi-Fi routers and network . Playbook has two and they 're both useless . <p> DAVOS ' BLACK TIE ARABIAN NIGHTS PARTY REVIEW : Let 's start with the positive : It was the most diverse , large crowd Playbook has seen at seven WEFs . On the other hand , the place felt like a wooden chalet version of a sardine can . Plenty of people wore sweaters rather than black tie . The place was lit red , and many in the audience seemed to have gone with red outfits too . Queen Diambi of the Democratic Republic of Congo had to beg the crowd to shut up during her remarks . <p> ACCESS + ABILITY : Steep slopes and ice do n't make Davos the most accessible place , but the Smithsonian 's ACCESS + ABILITY exhibit is raising awareness about the benefits of universal design , even in towns like this one . From the Nike FLYEASE shoes -- designed in collaboration with a teenager with cerebral palsy -- to the " soundshirt " that enables the hearing-impaired to appreciate an orchestra . Spotted : Will.i.am modeling the soundshirt . <p> **A message from Philip Morris International : Philip Morris International is delivering a smoke-free future .

Thorning-Schmidt headlined POLITICO 's cocktail party at Schatzalp last night ( see a 360-degree photo here from Twiplomacy 's Matthias L ? fkens ) , where 100 or so folk put their status-envy aside to mix across the badge classes and drink , debate and slide headfirst down the mountain . <p> GOOD MORNING from a chilly Davos . Pro Tip : Few activities will produce the pure joy of Schatzalp . We look forward to welcoming you to next year 's POLITICO Sled Run . Pics from last night here , here and here . <p> Fireworks : Our interview with Thorning-Schmidt is worth a listen -- she tears strips off Theresa May and her approach to Brexit , explains the critical value of supporting children raised in conflict and its aftermath , and says it 's time for a woman to hold one of the EU 's presidential positions . She 's also a fan of Michel Barnier , the EU Brexit negotiator , who many consider a top contender for European Commission president . It 's not hard to see the pair working well together . <h> TRENDING IN DAVOS <p> WHAT WE 'RE HEARING : It 's a fool 's game to predict a single mood or top issue across the entire WEF . But there seems to be a gap between loud public criticism of WEF participants and the event itself ( Bill Browder piles on here ) , and how those folks are behaving up the mountain . This year there 's less self-congratulatory guff and a more serious level of engagement among conference participants . The corporate speed dating of previous years is on the wane , and executives who previously did n't care about issues like refugee education or a functioning free press are actually listening to the consultancies and NGOs that insist that only leadership based on inclusion , diversity and sustainability can work in the future . The challenge : Can those leaders catch up with an increasingly angry public , and also tackle issues like tax ? <p> HAIR-RAISING MOMENTS : Did you know the crew at Kopp 's Coiffure is in action from 5:30 a.m. each morning this week , visiting hotel rooms and chalets to get the hair of the great , the good and the very , very rich ready for show ? The team expands from eight to 12 for WEF week , carting gear around in waterproof backpacks . They also have a huge new salon next to Congress Center open from 9 a.m. until 7 p.m. for those who ca n't bear the thought of an early morning hotel visit . Playbook can vouch for their in-salon skill . <p> **A message from Philip Morris International : We are delivering a smoke-free future , but we ca n't do it alone . We ask the world 's leaders to join us in a conversation : 1.1 billion cigarette smokers deserve better options . Support the vision for a smoke-free future .

( is the rating we gave Chinese President Xi Jinping for his glorious 2017 paean to globalization , sucking up to every pore of every being in the WEF realm ) . <p> OVERHEARD : A different type of ( be ) rating , at Anthony Scaramucci 's Skybridge wine tasting event Tuesday . One prominent editor criticized the WEF for choosing forum founder Klaus Schwab to interview Bolsonaro and WEF President B ? rge Brende for U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo , rather than journalists . " Blowjob " was the key word . Schwab resorted to the harshest form of criticism possible in Davos : An invitation to the audience to admire the natural beauties of Brazil . <p> THE MOOCH IS ON FIRE : Say what you will about Anthony Scaramucci 's notoriously loose mouth and flirtation with reality TV , but the Mooch knows how to be Donald Trump 's unchallenged main man in Davos , shutdown be damned . Last night 's Skybridge wine tasting was no exception : packed to the rafters , white-badge-holders galore being turned down for entry , and full of 97-point wines . The one point of backlash : the sip-sized servings . No one was there to learn to be a connoisseur ! <p> GREAT IDEA : Budweiser is to power all of Atlanta with green energy when it hosts the Super Bowl February 3 . <h> NOT TRENDING IN DAVOS <p> SAUDI MINISTER SET TO PULL OUT : He would n't be particularly welcome , but one upside to Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih 's attendance could be some actual diplomacy between him and his Russian counterpart Alexander Novak -- their first face-to-face meeting since they orchestrated a new OPEC+ output agreement in Vienna in December . ( Though that conversation might further cement the idea that Davos is more welcoming to nasty governments than it should be . ) Bloomberg reports Khalid Al-Falih 's " travel plans are still in flux , so it 's still possible , albeit unlikely , he makes a flying visit to Davos on Friday . " <p> REFUNDS PLEASE ! Our Stateside colleague Daniel Lippman reports that a White House official told POLITICO the Trump administration is hard at work trying to get back the taxpayer dollars dropped on Davos hotels , before the Americans ' trip was canceled due to the U.S. government shutdown . The official said they hope to get the vast majority of the money back in the next few weeks . It 's a lot of cash : Quartz reported in December that the hotel tab for Donald Trump , a number of Cabinet members and other officials ( including Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner ) had already hit about $2.9 million . <p> WHO NEEDS FEEDBACK ? ' JUST KEEP GOING : ' DHL chief Frank Appel has a message for his fellow globalizers : " Just keep going . " He told CNBC Tuesday morning that his company 's annual connectedness survey shows 2017 was globalization 's best year ever , with 2018 a close second . " Globalization is not on the retreat , it 's continued , despite all the noise . So , sometimes I say , better do n't open the newspapers , just keep going , " he said . Appel expanded on the comments on Tuesday 's POLITICO WEF panel with our Global Editor Matt Kaminski . Also on the panel : UBS ' Sabine Keller-Busse , WEF 's Richard Samans , and Lippo Group 's James Riady . <p> CATCHPHRASE CAR CRASH : Are we living in a " 5G World , " " Globalization 4.0 " or the " Fourth Industrial Revolution ? " WEF needs to decide . At this rate it 's destined to be the public-private partnership version of the European Commission : so chock-full of people who feel entitled to be heard , the message often gets lost . <p> SLOW DOWN , IT 'S ONLY A SLOWDOWN NOT A COLLAPSE : The WEF really wants you to know that slower growth does n't equal recession . The forum predicts central banks are likely to moderate monetary policy to keep economic " soft spots " from turning into sharp declines , and says it hopes the opening up of China 's market will soften the blows . " Slowing down in China is not a collapse , " noted Fang Xinghai , the vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission , in Davos . Economic experts predict 6-percent growth in China for 2019 , which seems strong , but is often regarding as the tipping point into social chaos in China if it goes any lower . <h> TODAY 'S BUSINESS <p> EUROPE DAY -- IN SAFE WATERS AGAIN : It 's Europe Day in Davos , with leaders of three out of the five biggest economies speaking today . German Chancellor Angela Merkel gets the special 45-minute treatment ( plus her session is chaired by WEF founder Klaus Schwab ) . Italy 's Giuseppe Conte and Spain 's Pedro S ? nchez follow later in the afternoon , with half an hour each . <p> European self-evaluation : . " It 's a fact that in the past two years , Europe has provided much-needed ' life-support ' to the global multilateral order , and that 's despite all the internal challenges we faced , especially Brexit , " Ann Mettler told Playbook . She 's the head of EPSC , the European Commission 's in-house think tank . " I do n't know where the climate agenda would be if the COP24 had failed without our help in brokering a deal , or how much stronger protectionism would be had we not tried to counter it with an active trade policy . " Read the latest EPSC paper , pegged to the WEF . <p> HAPPENING TODAY -- EU-JAPAN DATA DOUBLE ACT : The European Commission will today certify that data transferred from the EU to Japan enjoys protection standards in line with European ones . And with that , the two can lay claim to having created the world 's largest area of data flows reciprocally considered safe . <p> Why are we telling you ? First , because unless you read Brussels Playbook ( BTW : you really should ! ) , you would n't have known about it . Second , Japan 's PM Abe , speaking in Davos today , is expected to announce that his government will take the same decision today , diplomats told us.The EU and Japan are putting yet another piece in place for the biggest trade and economic partnership agreement ever concluded by the EU , which is yet another occasion for the so-far endless series of their joint efforts to demonstrate that rule-based trade is alive and kicking . <p> ON THAT NOTE , FREE TRADE IS GREAT , SAYS LEADERLESS BRITISH DELEGATION ... on one of the most expensive billboards in Davos . Ministerial back-up will arrive today -- up to seven members of the U.K. Cabinet will be in Davos . <p> FACEBOOK WATCH : The company 's engagement ramps up today , to include a media reception and an in-demand speech session featuring COO Sheryl Sandberg and hosted by German newspaper Die Zeit . <h> TUESDAY WRAP <p> MIKE POMPEO 'S ' BEAUTIFUL COALITIONS : ' U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave a boiler-plate recitation of the Trump administration 's claimed achievements and its " unleashing of animal spirits " to help the economy grow . He praised " beautiful coalitions " and repeated the claim that ISIS has been defeated . He rejected the idea that conflict with China is inevitable , but said transparency and fairness is needed from Beijing to avoid trade and other clashes . He likewise said the U.S. and Russia are not " destined to be antagonists but it will take a Russian change " to keep the peace . <p> On reforms he wants to see in NATO , the UN and EU : " I do n't have time today to go into each of them ... but it 's not about taking these institutions down , " Pompeo said . He added that " voters have tuned out politics " and are revolting around the world . " People are asking questions that have n't been asked , or have n't been taken seriously for a very long time , " Pompeo said , characterizing Donald Trump 's election as a fightback against " low expectations . " <p> Pompeo rated:Playbook gives his speech . His prepared text was n't memorable , but he talked soft and angled hard on the WEF 's weak point : That its elite audiences avoid hard questions about how they got to be so successful . <p> BRAZILIAN OFFER YOU CA N'T RESIST : Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro gave the WEF crowd another opportunity to choose between their collective sense of responsibility as citizens of everywhere and the business opportunities that a strict -- or should we say brutal -- anti-corruption agenda might bring . " Our measures will certainly provide you with incentives to do business , " said Bolsonaro , presenting the " new Brazil that we 're building " as a place open to trading with the world and to investment . His plans include pouring cash into safety and security , he said , " so you all can come visit with your families . " <p> Bolsonaro ( who strangely wore an overcoat on stage -- is that a new thing ? ) argued environmental issues " need to go hand-in-hand " with economic development , meaning " one must not emphasize one over the other , and insisted only 9 percent of Brazil 's soil was used by farmers today . <p> WHERE WERE THE WOMEN ? At Tina Brown 's annual Women of Impact dinner , hosted with Credit Suisse for the eighth time . The key speeches were from Michelle Bachelet , who was recently appointed as the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and was Chile 's first female president , and Lina Khalifeh , the Jordanian founder of SheFighter , a self-defense studio . Other guests included IMF chief Christine Lagarde , Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala and Queen Rania of Jordan , who turned up for dessert . Brown kicked on at Davos House . <h> NEW DEAL FOR NATURE <p> WHOSE PLANET IS IT ANYWAY ? Naturalist David Attenborough has a new Netflix series to promote , which will debut at the WEF . It 's called " Our Planet " and looks spectacular , judging from a clip the audience previewed Tuesday . Not bad work for a 92-year-old icon . He offered the Davos crown an 11th commandment to observe : " Care for the natural world , and treat it with a deal of respect , " he told an admiring Duke of Cambridge , who got to interview him on stage . <p> So what 's it all about ? A " New Deal for Nature , " as a follow-up and extension of the Paris Climate Agreement . Playbook 's Florian Eder sat down for a chat with WWF International 's Director-General Marco Lambertini , whose organization is pushing for the new deal . <p> Lambertini 's challenge to WEF attendees : " This is the group of people that accounts for most of the carbon footprint today , so it goes without saying that it must be also the group of people that must start to design the solution , " he told Playbook . " And business is beginning to get it . " His evidence for that ? " In Davos , we 've been always confronting this sector . Today , we 're working together . It 's amazing that that happened only in a decade , " Lambertini said . <p> What is that new deal ? " We need to produce more food with less of everything . Less water , less land , less energy , fertilizers , less pesticides . Today , the food system is broken , is clearly not sustainable , we 're heading towards a collapse of the food system . We need to green that system , with clear targets . " <p> Lambertini says we are not doing enough on the climate , but should n't stop there anyway : " If climate is dangerous enough for business , do n't think that a collapse of the ocean of the forest system , will be less dangerous . " <p> Lambertini on Bolsonaro : Brazil 's strongman president started his term by making it easier to deforest the Amazon . " Bolsonaro is not the first , " said Lambertini . " And look what happened when Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from Paris : A wave of companies , states and mayors , stepped up and said ' we 're still in , we want to contribute even if the government does n't . ' Sometimes , these kind of radical views trigger and accelerate reaction from society , but of course they are also a concern . " <p> What would Lambertini tell Bolsonaro if he ran into him in Davos ? " I would like to say that people like Trump , Bolsonaro -- sovereignists , unilateralists , populists -- were not elected on anti-environmental agendas . The majority in America are concerned about climate change . They experience it three or four times a year now . That 's what we are trying to convey to these leaders : Do n't embrace an anti-environmental agenda , because you 're failing a large part of your electorate . " <p> THANKS to Natasha Bernard , Giulia Chiatante and Dari Gessner for making last night 's POLITICO party possible .

Created by Freuds and set in a cozy , low-ceilinged golf club , Davos House instantly set itself apart from other crammed venues in town , not least because it afforded Blaine the chance to wow a crowd that included Queen Rania of Jordan and former U.K. Chancellor George Osborne with a series of stunning card illusions . <p> The takeaway : The Davos audience may be in the land of 24/7 make-believe ( where the cards are always stacked ) , but Blaine provided the first illusion that actually impressed everyone . <p> PLAN B : If you 're not on the door list at Davos House , do n't worry . Indonesia 's WIR Group is offering you the chance to test its " Location-Based Augmented Reality Game Platform " from 3:30 to 4:30 p.m. today at the Indonesia Pavillon . It sounds rather like Brexit . And if you 'd rather find out what it 's like to be a tree ( yes , really ) , then visit the Tree VR exhibition inside the Congress Center . We 'd give you a preview , but the organizers said WEF had n't told them if journalists were allowed in . <p> DAVOS PRO TIP -- MAKE A DINNER EFFORT : The thing everyone hates ( but insists on having ) in Davos is an invite to a private dinner . They 're annoying because getting around Davos is complicated , but they 're also a good chance to pick apart whatever has happened on the main stage that day . Nearly every big company runs one , as do consultancies , including Brunswick and Finsbury 's tonight . <p> Playbook -- along with HuffPost 's Louise Roug -- kicked off the International Hotel Group dinner Monday at the InterContinental , where Prince William and many of the big leaders stay . It was a refreshingly grounded discussion . Listen to the first episode of our Davos Confidential podcast , featuring Roug and former Formula One driver Nico Rosberg , to find out more . What made the IHG dinner work is that everyone debated on an equal footing .

But what Davos-goers tend to collectively recoil at is bearers of bad news , or those who doubt everything can be " win-win . " <p> If that sounds like a fundamental clash , that 's because it is . <p> How else do you explain organizations repeatedly warning about extreme inequality at the WEF , while the decision-makers who attend the forum ( and their companies ) grow markedly wealthier , some of them exponentially so , off the back of cheap debt and tax avoidance . That might be unfair but manageable if the wages and opportunities of the global middle and working classes were n't stagnating in many countries . A new worldwide UNICEF survey of 10,000 youth demonstrated staggeringly simple asks : more jobs and better education . Something 's got to give to fund those demands -- perhaps higher tax . If not , the response to exponential wealth might be exponential populism . <h> OH THE HUMANITY <p> NO MORE DAVOS MAN : " Human " is the word popping up everywhere this year .

Responsibility and transparency will be the keywords during a panel at 5.45 p.m. today called " Business Leadership in the Fourth Industrial Revolution . " Rometty 's also part of the wave of tech leaders prepared to say that " carefully targeted " government regulation is a good thing , not the devil . <p> CLIMATE CHANGE BANKRUPTCIES : The Wall Street Journal 's Russell Gold writes that California 's largest utility PG&amp;E Corp was overwhelmed by rapid climatic change as a prolonged drought dried out much of the state and decimated forests . On Monday the company , which was recently valued at $25 billion , said it planned to file for Chapter 11 protection by month 's end , citing an estimated $30 billion in liabilities and 750 lawsuits from wildfires potentially caused by its power lines . Its value has sunk to $4 billion . <p> WHAT DO CEOS THINK ? PwC asked Davos Man ( and occasional woman ) in its 22nd annual survey of the world 's bosses . Almost one in three CEOs globally said they thought economic growth will decline over the course of this year . That 's about six times as many as last year , " a record jump in pessimism , " as the annual survey of 1,300 CEOs around the world notes . " CEOs also reported a noteworthy dip in confidence in their own organizations ' revenue prospects over the short ( 12-month ) and medium ( three-year ) term . " More of them think AI will destroy more jobs than it creates . <p> Corporate oracles : The report , published Monday evening , has been a good indicator of the mood of the globe 's economic elite in the past -- and of how the real economy 's doing . The silver lining : 42 percent of the respondents still foresee an improved economic outlook ( down from 57 percent last year ) . <p> A DAVOS RECORD ?

But the WEF 's an inclusive place . <h> WHAT OTHERS ARE SAYING ABOUT DAVOS <p> Rob Cox for Reuters brands Davos " a liability in the populist era " to explain why Donald Trump , Emmanuel Macron , Theresa May , Narendra Modi and Justin Trudeau are skipping this year 's summit . But that leaves room for the leaders of Ethiopia , Vietnam and South Africa , for example . <p> David A. Andelman for CNN says Trump is smart to skip Davos , though he still ca n't distinguish between useful and expendable international events . <p> Jorge Valero for Euractiv compliments the WEF on raising tough issues but concludes : " The sense of urgency is short-lived , as fairer salaries and more inclusive societies are n't part of CEOs ' speed-dating chats or the fancy Russian parties in the Swiss resort .

The " global expansion is weakening and at a rate that is somewhat faster than expected , " the IMF 's new chief economist , Gita Gopinath , wrote on her blog . <p> The queen of the mountain , Christine Lagarde , said at a press conference Monday that the IMF would " now announce a further downgrade of our forecast . The bottom line is , after two years of solid expansion , the world economy is growing more slowly than expected and risks are rising , " especially because free trade is becoming a toxic cause and old models of multilateralism are falling apart . Expect a " serious slowdown " if policymakers do n't change course by keeping trade open , reducing public debt , shutting down tax avoidance and making sure the digital revolution is inclusive . <p> DAVID CAMERON 'S ' STUPID ' REFERENDUM : Unlike most of the British government , which is stuck at home managing the mess of Brexit , David Cameron is back in Davos .

" Donald Tusk tells the BBC about conversations he had with Cameron back in 2016 , in which the European Council president said he told the then-British PM to " get real " as he was trying to negotiate a deal with the EU ahead of the " stupid " Brexit referendum . " I told him bluntly , ' come on David , get real . I know that all prime ministers are promising to help you , but believe me the truth is that no one has an appetite for revolution in Europe only because of your stupid referendum .

@@41694141 <h> Can Apple sustain strong momentum amid coronavirus fears ? <p> Apple has reported record results for the three months to December , beating Wall Street estimates . <p> Its newly launched iPhone 11 series brought sales of the iconic smartphone back to the growth path while other new businesses such as wearables and subscription services achieved double-digit growth . <p> As Apple is set to launch its 5G products later this year , such strong results demonstrated that the technology giant can still grow its iPhone business even though the global smartphone market is slowing down . <p> The iPhone business contributed US$56 billion in revenue for the quarter , up 8 percent from a year earlier . The strong growth was mainly due to the strong demand for the iPhone 11 series . Apple said iPhone 11 , the cheapest model of the series , was the top-selling model for every week in December . The three models of the series also proved the most popular iPhones . <p> Apple has been shifting its business strategy for the iPhone in view of the global smartphone market slowdown .

The iPhone is no longer a product just for the high-end market , but it can also serve the mid-range segment . <p> As the company sought to capture the mid-range clientele and even the entry-level market , it has been rumored that Apple would launch an iPhone with a smaller screen size in the first quarter this year . <p> It is said that the new iPhone , dubbed iPhone SE2 , could come with a 4.7-inch screen and the latest A13 processor , and the price could be as low as US$39 . <p> Some media outlets reported that Apple was aiming to ship 15 million units @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urged its partners to ship a total of 80 million units of iPhones in the first half amid a stronger than expected demand . <p> Unfortunately , Apple 's ambitious plan could be affected by the outbreak of the new coronavirus in Wuhan , the capital of central China 's Hubei province . <p> The epicenter of the outbreak is near the iPhone manufacturing bases .

However , Foxconn , an iPhone contract maker , said that the company has a contingency plan to maintain its iPhone business . <p> While no details have been provided , it can be assumed that Foxconn will make the latest model in India and Taiwan , where it also has iPhone manufacturing plants . <p> The strong iPhone demand led to an increase in the number of active users within Apple ecosystem . Apple said its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , up by over 100 million in the last 12 months . <p> The active installed base is a key indicator of Apple users ' stickiness to its ecosystem . Such a huge user base serves as a solid foundation for Apple to expand its service business , especially its subscription-based services . <p> Apple said it had over 480 million paid subscriptions across the services , up 120 million from a year ago . It expects to surpass the 500 million mark during the March quarter . <p> The company has set a new target of 600 million paid subscriptions before the end of this year , and this means 40 percent of Apple installed bases are paying for services . <p> Unique service offerings <p> During the reporting period , revenue for services reached US$12.7 billion , up around 18 percent from a year earlier . <p> The company was able to attract users to try its unique service offerings such as payment , news , music and cloud storage . <p> For example , Apple Pay 's revenue and transactions more than doubled year-over-year with a run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment system was accepted in more public transport systems such as trains and buses in London , Shenzhen and Guangzhou . <p> Apple News , on the other hand , attracted over 100 million monthly active users in the United States , Australia and Canada , and provided a curated and personalized experience using on-device intelligence to recommend stories . <p> Such services did help to lock users to the iPhone as it provided some exclusive content for them . <p> The coronavirus may eventually hit hardware sales in China as shops are closed . <p> But Apple 's overall growth momentum should not be affected as its users continue to spend more on service subscriptions , and the rising penetration of Apple Pay will also help boost service revenue . <p> SpaceX , the private rocket company of high-tech entrepreneur Elon Musk , won final approval to build a research and manufacturing plant for its deep-space Starship project on a tract of vacant land at the Port ... <p> California power producer PG&amp;E Corp said on Tuesday that it plans to raise up to US$25.68 billion by selling securities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process , Reuters reports .

Phenylpyrovirogradnaya oligophrenia is a disease that results in degradation of the amino acid called phenylalanine . This amino acid presents in protein-containing food . High levels of phenylalanine can cause problems of mental development throughout life . If diet therapy is not used among children under two , then such violations lead to irreversible deviations in the development of the brain . Increasing the level of phenylalanine in the blood of an adult can reduce the level of mental abilities and reaction speed . <p> Director of the IKBFU 's Institute of Living Systems , Olga Babich said : <p> " Today scientists are looking for new ways of treatment of hereditary diseases .

For example , one of the ways is enzymotherapy - enzyme treatment . But in Russia those methods are not used due to the lack of available technologies . While the most promising is the use in the treatment of an enzyme called " L-phenylalanine-ammonium lyase " , both in the form of injections and capsules/pills , which breaks down phenylalanine to safe products . The therapeutic use of this enzyme is limited by its instability , especially in the acidic environment of the stomach .

This will be the last meeting for Mark Carney after a stint of over six years guiding the bank 's monetary policy . <h> Will we see any change to monetary policy ? <p> The past fortnight has seen huge volatility in the market expectations of a rate cut . Coming a month after the UK general election on 12 December , we have seen significant volatility around each economic reading released throughout recent weeks . Initial signs of a November and December weakness came via declines in retail sales ( -0.6% ) , monthly gross domestic product ( GDP ) at -0.3% , and industrial production ( -1.2% ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was plenty of reasoning behind the flurry of dovish comments that came our way from the likes of Carney and monetary policy committee ( MPC ) members Michael Saunders , Silvana Tenreyro and Gertjan Vlieghe . Adding those names to the already dovish Jonathan Haskel , there is a strong chance we will see the MPC cut rates on Thursday . <p> However , the past week has seen that dovish message undermined somewhat , with the provisional January purchasing managers index ( PMI ) surveys showing a huge jump in the services sector . If confirmed , that rise would see services grow at the fastest rate in 16 months . This highlights a likely economic recovery that could take shape over the coming months . However , with a coronavirus curveball now raising the possibility of a China-focused shock to the global growth picture , we are seeing expectations of a rate cut increase once again . This takes us back into a position where there is a market majority for a cut , with options markets pricing in a 52% chance that Carney will lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we look out for ? <p> After a long period of stability , the recent election and Brexit agreement has helped free up the BoE to take action if they see it as being necessary . This is a genuine coin-toss meeting , with the 52% market expectation of a rate cut highlighting that we are almost guaranteed volatility on the day . It is worthwhile noting that at 0.75% , the headline interest rate is unlikely to fall much further beyond the 25 basis-point move that many are calling for . Thus , there is a strong chance we will see a ' hawkish cut ' which sees the bank provide commentary that paves the way for a less dovish stance going forward . <p> This meeting also sees the release of the quarterly monetary policy report , or inflation report . This provides forecasts for both growth and inflation , which adds yet another dimension for traders to keep their eye on . Given the potential coronavirus implications on growth and energy prices , there is plenty for the committee to consider . Not to mention the phase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where now for the pound ? <p> GBP/USD has been on the slide in the lead up to this meeting , with fears over a potential rate cut clearly impacting confidence despite recent gains . However , this brings us back into a provisional support trendline , following a break below trendline and Fibonacci support . Ultimately , we need to see a break below $1.2962 to bring about a more bearish outlook for this pair . Until then , there is a strong chance that we will see the bulls come back into play as the pair seeks to build on the recent intraday trend of higher highs and higher lows . <p> This information has been prepared by IG , a trading name of IG Markets Limited .

USA , Jan 25 ( ANI ) : Physicians are worried after they found traces of Marijuana in a number of heart patients . While smoking tobacco leads to one in every four cardiovascular disease-related deaths , the cause of similar effects from using marijuana is still not entirely known . Various studies suggest that Marijuana can be the inducer for triggering heart attacks and strokes.The report got published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.Ersilia DeFilippis , MD , a second-year cardiology fellow at Columbia University Irving Medical Center and NewYork-Presbyterian , delved into marijuana 's effect on the heart a few years ago while studying heart attacks in people under 50 . She said , " We noted that 10 percent of patients in a registry of young heart attack patients had used marijuana and/or cocaine . " Ersilia and her colleagues recently went through the medical literature to find out about the facts about the substance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2016 , that over 2 Million People with heart disease have used marijuana .

" In addition to the 2 million marijuana users with diagnosed cardiovascular disease , many more may be at risk , " DeFilippis says . " With many adolescents and young adults turning to marijuana , it is important to understand the cardiovascular implications they may face years down the line . " Researchers believe that cannabinoids may increase the activity of some prescribed drugs in the body . But limited data are available to guide physicians in adjusting the dose to compensate for marijuana use.THC is the most psychoactive chemical in marijuana , but marijuana also contains more than 100 compounds , called cannabinoids , that are chemically related to THC . The percentage of THC contained in marijuana plant has steadily increased over the past 30 years . " Higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the vasculature , and the muscle of the heart , " DeFilippis says . " It also highlights the need for real-world data given the variety of marijuana products and formulations available for purchase . " Receptors for cannabinoids are highly concentrated in the nervous system but also can be found in blood cells , muscle cells , and other tissues and organs . A small experimental study found that smoking marijuana can bring on angina ( chest pain ) more quickly in patients with coronary heart disease compared with smoking a placebo.Though current evidence for a link between marijuana and heart attacks is modest , it 's thought that smoking marijuana may increase cellular stress and inflammation , which are known to be precipitating factors for coronary artery disease and heart attacks.Cerebrovascular events , including strokes , also have been associated with marijuana use . It 's thought that marijuana may induce changes in the inner lining of blood vessels or alter blood flow .

" Therefore , asking patients about marijuana use may help in risk assessment . In addition , we know that marijuana use affects the metabolism of many common cardiac drugs .

With a host of benchmarks on the ' risk on ' side of the spectrum posting notable -- albeit short-term -- technical breakdowns , the ranks were on high alert for signs of follow through deleveraging . Beyond the simple high levels of favorite milestones like top global equity indices , there are various measures for exposure which paint a troubling picture for a market that comes under any severe stress . Below is the NYSE 's brokerage leverage between credit and debit balances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , recognition of risk alone is not enough to pitch the market into a tailspin . The question is when this tipping point is met which in turn leads many to obsess ( myself included ) of the ' how ' it will be prompted . <p> Chart of S&amp;P 500 and NYSE Broker-Level ' Leverage ' ( Monthly ) <p> Chart made by John Kicklighter with data from Bloomberg Platform <p> If your preference is not to lead with fundamentals and evaluating the difficult-to-register priorities of a crowd , there are technical milestones that are important as well . The correlation , direction and pace of risk-sensitive assets is my preferred measure of speculative conviction . That said , there are certain individual benchmarks that can offer interesting insight on a more timely basis . The S&amp;P 500 for example is perhaps one of the most frequently referenced and heavily traded ( through derivatives ) such market leader , but its interaction with the prominent channel of the past three months leaves open greater interpretation . That is n't so for the Dow ( and Nasdaq ) . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new resistance . Looking to some of the other risk measures I like to follow , their ability to close their bearish gaps to start the week was far less remarkable , leaving broader conviction more likely more attuned to concern . <h> What Are the Top Fundamental Themes to Watch Ahead ? <p> With the question of the bearing in global sentiment as seemingly contentious as it has been in three months , the natural next step is to start looking for the practical catalysts that can tip the scales one way or the other . Yet , before you consider what will dominant the headlines , consider the underlying bias of the markets . I 've highlighted many times before that there have been periods where good news has gone unnoticed by the market while the bad triggers an avalanche of fear , and visa versa . That is the inherent bias that can shape the influence of not just event risk , but broader fundamental themes as well . Against this backdrop , it is also worth noting that certain themes can also hold greater potential through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poll I conducted in Twitter asking traders what they thought the most important theme would be over the next session . A thin margin voted the coronavirus headlines . This is not a theme that can really charge optimism and even relief could be difficult to muster given the nature of the situation . Consider that should the headlines and relative China market performance metrics ( Dow to FXI rather than USDCNH ) start to command headlines . <p> Poll from @JohnKicklighter Handle in Twitter.com <p> A marginal difference to the second place most market-moving threat find the FOMC decision due Wednesday afternoon in Washington DC stirring considerable interest . From a risk perspective , this particular topic has prompted much more speculative relief and risk build up based in complacency speculative reach over the past years . Monetary policy 's general effectiveness is a latent concern among some ( myself a big proponent of this monitoring ) , but that is the exception to the rule . Most still see central banks as ready-serving backstops to any disruption in the market . That makes it more prone to spur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probability of change at this meeting is low , but the market is pricing in anticipation throughout 2020 . In fact , there is chance of both cuts and hikes looking ahead . <h> Growth Interests Will Be Waiting to Take the Reins After the Fed Passes <p> While the focus will be on the Fed when it comes to the broad and targeted influence of monetary policy , it is worth mentioning the Bank of England ( BOE ) is on deck for its own policy assessment on Thursday . This is particularly important for the Sterling and GBPUSD in particular , though it may not rise to the occasion of a global sentiment catalyst . The interest is based in the contentious 50 percent probability of a rate cut at the gathering according to swaps . That means that at least half of the market will be surprised one way or the other . That degree of volatility potential will give pause to any traders tempted to take significant exposure with that uncertainty just around the corner . <p> Chart of GBPUSD with 200-Day Moving Average <p> Chart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain greater traction as the week wears on is the health of the global economy . The most prominent listings are the US and Euro-area 4Q GDP updates due Thursday and Friday respectively . However , there is other data that will draw attention to the general theme -- and recession fears if the data prints poorly -- in the interim session . This past session offered up a mixed view form the world 's largest economy with a US consumer confidence vaulting to 131.6 ( from 128.2 ) for the Conference Board 's January update but non-defense durable goods orders excluding transportation ( one of the more popular proxies for GDP ) dropped unexpectedly by -0.9 percent . The US 10-year to 2-year yield curve bounced alongside risk trends , but the pressure is still clearly present . For Wednesday , earnings will take center stage .
